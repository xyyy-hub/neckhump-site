## 🐛 **Issues Found & Fixed**

### **Issue #1: Syntax Error in /neck-hump-exercises/page.js**

**Problem:**
- Build error: "Unterminated regexp literal" at line 1420
- Duplicate closing tags - component function ended at line 1308, but then more JSX content appeared after that

**Root Cause:**
- When adding new components, the code was inserted after orphaned content that was outside the component function

**Fix:**
- Removed duplicate `</div>  )  }` at lines 1306-1308
- Kept single closing at the end after all new components

**Status:** ✅ FIXED & VERIFIED
