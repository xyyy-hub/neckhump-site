## Problem Summary

- **Impact:** Google may see as doorway pages, reduces indexing priority

### 3. **Low Crawl Priority Signals**
- Help pages at priority 0.6 (lowest tier)
- Deep URL structure (3-4 levels: /help/category/subcategory/article)
- Recently added pages (January 15, 2025 - only 6 days old when checked)
