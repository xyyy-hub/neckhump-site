### **5. /exercise-library/page.js** (Pending)
**Status:** ⏸️ Skipped for now - already has comprehensive internal linking structure

**Reasoning:** The exercise-library page already links to all 16 exercises + related pages. Adding RelatedArticles would be redundant. Will revisit if engagement metrics suggest users need additional guidance.

---

## 🎯 **Strategic Placement Decisions**

### **NavigationPathway Deployment:**
Added to **2 pages** strategically placed in user journey:

1. **/neck-hump-exercises** (Stage: "exercises")
   - Users actively doing exercises
   - Next step: Fix environment (desk/sleep)

2. **/how-to-fix-posture-at-home** (Stage: "maintenance")  
   - Users completing comprehensive plan
   - Next step: Prevention and long-term habits

**Why not all 5 pages?**
- NavigationPathway works best when placed at specific journey stages
- Overuse dilutes its effectiveness
- Other pages (/neck-hump-guide, /posture-correction-guide) are educational/overview - don't fit linear progression

### **RelatedArticles Deployment:**
Added to **4 pages** with strategic link selection:

**Link Selection Criteria:**
1. **Complementary Content**: Articles that answer "what next?" for current page
2. **Mix of Categories**: Balance of exercises, prevention, treatment, guides
3. **Traffic Distribution**: Push users toward underutilized high-value pages
4. **Topic Clustering**: Reinforce topical authority in posture niche
