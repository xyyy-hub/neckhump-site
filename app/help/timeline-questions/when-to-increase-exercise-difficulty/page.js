  const shortAnswer = "Increase neck exercise difficulty when you can complete your current routine without pain for 2-3 weeks, when exercises feel too easy, or when you've achieved your current goals. Progress gradually by adding repetitions, holding positions longer, or adding resistance. Never progress if you experience increased pain or new symptoms."

    {
      title: "Pain-Free Performance is Required",
      content: "You should be able to complete your current exercises without any pain for at least 2-3 weeks before progressing. If you experience pain during or after exercises, you're not ready to advance. Pain is your body's warning system."
    },
    {
      title: "Consistency Over Intensity",
      content: "It's better to do easier exercises consistently than to push too hard and get injured. Most people progress too quickly and end up with setbacks. Focus on building a solid foundation before advancing."
    },
    {
      title: "Individual Progression Varies",
      content: "Everyone progresses at different rates based on age, fitness level, medical conditions, and injury history. Don't compare your progress to others. Focus on your own improvement and listen to your body's signals."
    },
    {
      title: "Quality Over Quantity",
      content: "Perfect form with fewer repetitions is better than poor form with more repetitions. Before increasing difficulty, ensure you can maintain proper technique throughout your current routine. Poor form can lead to injury."

        "Increase repetitions by 2-5 per exercise",
        "Hold positions for 2-5 seconds longer",
        "Add resistance (light weights, resistance bands)",

  const faqData = [
    {
      question: "How do I know when I'm ready to increase exercise difficulty?",
      answer: "You're ready to progress when you can complete your current routine without pain for 2-3 weeks, when exercises feel too easy or unchallenging, when you've achieved your current goals, and when you can maintain perfect form throughout your routine. Never progress if you experience increased pain or new symptoms."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the signs I'm progressing too quickly?",
      answer: "Warning signs include increased pain during or after exercise, new symptoms like headaches or dizziness, decreased range of motion, increased stiffness, poor sleep quality, or feeling exhausted rather than energized after exercise. If you experience any of these, reduce intensity immediately."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I increase exercise difficulty?",
      answer: "Most people can safely progress every 2-4 weeks, but this varies significantly based on individual factors. Some people may progress weekly, while others may need 6-8 weeks between progressions. Focus on consistent improvement rather than rapid advancement."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the best way to increase difficulty for neck exercises?",
      answer: "Start by increasing repetitions (add 2-5 per exercise), then increase hold times (add 2-5 seconds), then add resistance (light weights or resistance bands), and finally add new exercise variations. Always progress one element at a time and monitor your response carefully."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I increase difficulty if I have a medical condition?",
      answer: "If you have medical conditions like arthritis, herniated discs, or other neck problems, progression should be much slower and more conservative. Work with a healthcare provider or physical therapist to develop a safe progression plan. Some conditions may require maintaining current levels rather than advancing."
