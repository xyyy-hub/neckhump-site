  const shortAnswer = "For neck hump correction, aim for 2-3 exercise sessions daily, each lasting 5-15 minutes. Start with once daily and gradually increase frequency.

      title: "Start Small and Build",
      content: "Begin with 5-10 minutes once daily and gradually increase frequency. Don't try to do everything at once - this often leads to burnout. Focus on building the habit first, then increasing duration and frequency."
    },
    {
      title: "Listen to Your Body",
      content: "If you feel sore or fatigued, it's okay to take a rest day or reduce intensity. Overtraining can lead to injury and setbacks. Your body needs time to adapt and recover between sessions."

    {
      title: "Quality Over Quantity",

  const faqData = [
    {
      question: "How many times per day should I do neck exercises?",
      answer: "For optimal results, aim for 2-3 exercise sessions daily, each lasting 5-15 minutes. Start with once daily and gradually increase frequency. This approach provides consistent reinforcement for posture changes while allowing adequate recovery time between sessions."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it better to do exercises once a day for longer or multiple times for shorter periods?",
      answer: "Multiple shorter sessions are generally more effective than one long session. This approach provides consistent reinforcement throughout the day, prevents fatigue, and helps maintain better form. It also fits better into most people's daily schedules."
    },
    {
      question: "How many days per week should I do neck exercises?",
      answer: "Aim for 5-6 days per week. Your body needs some rest days to recover and adapt. However, you can still do very gentle stretches or posture awareness activities on rest days. Consistency is more important than perfection."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I miss a day or two of exercises?",
      answer: "Missing occasional days is normal and won't significantly impact your progress. Don't try to 'make up' for missed days by doing extra exercises - this can lead to overuse injuries. Simply resume your normal routine and focus on consistency going forward."
    },
    {
      question: "How long should each exercise session be?",
      answer: "Each session should be 5-15 minutes, depending on your fitness level and available time. Beginners should start with 5-10 minutes, while more experienced individuals can do 10-15 minutes. Quality and consistency are more important than session length."
