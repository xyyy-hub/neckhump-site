      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Tracking Progress Matters for Neck Hump Correction</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Neck hump correction is a gradual process taking 3-6 months for noticeable visual changes and 6-12 months for 
        significant improvement. Because progress is slow, it's easy to feel discouraged and lose motivation without 
        objective tracking. Your brain adapts to your changing appearance, making it nearly impossible to notice gradual 
        improvements without comparison tools. Proper tracking provides motivation, identifies what's working, and alerts 
        you when adjustments are needed.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        More importantly, tracking prevents the common mistake of judging progress solely by appearance. Functional 
        improvements (reduced pain, better posture endurance, increased strength) often precede visible changes by weeks 
        or months. By tracking multiple metrics, you capture the full scope of progress and maintain motivation during 
        plateaus when visual changes stall.

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">1. Monthly Progress Photos (Most Important)</h4>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Take side-view photos against a plain wall in the same location, same lighting 
            (natural daylight is best), same outfit (fitted top that shows neck/shoulders), same time of day. Stand 
            naturally - don't intentionally correct posture. Take photos on the first day of each month.
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Technical setup:</strong> Have someone else take the photo from exactly 6 feet away at shoulder height, 
            or use phone on tripod with timer. Include a reference point in background (door frame, wall edge) to ensure 
            consistent positioning across months.
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Why it works:</strong> Visual comparison over months shows changes your brain can't detect day-to-day. 
            Side-by-side photos from months 0, 3, and 6 provide powerful motivation and objective proof of progress.

          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Stand with back against wall, heels about 3 inches from wall. Stand naturally 
            (don't force head back). Have someone measure distance from wall to the back of your head using a ruler or 
            tape measure in centimeters. Record this weekly.
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>What it means:</strong>
            <ul className="ml-4 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>• Normal: 0-2 cm (head touches or nearly touches wall)</li>
              <li>• Mild forward head: 2-5 cm</li>
              <li>• Moderate forward head: 5-8 cm</li>
              <li>• Severe forward head: >8 cm</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Why it works:</strong> Provides objective quantitative measure that's more sensitive than visual 
            assessment. Small reductions (even 0.5-1 cm) indicate real progress before visual changes are obvious.

          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Use your monthly side-view photo. Draw/overlay lines: one horizontal from C7 
            (prominent bone at base of neck) to ear canal, one vertical from C7 upward. Measure the angle between these 
            lines using protractor app or photo editing software.
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>What it means:</strong>
            <ul className="ml-4 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>• Normal CVA: &gt;52-54 degrees</li>
              <li>• Mild forward head: 48-52 degrees</li>
              <li>• Moderate forward head: 44-48 degrees</li>
              <li>• Severe forward head: &lt;44 degrees</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Why it works:</strong> Clinical standard for measuring forward head posture. More precise than 
            subjective visual assessment. CVA increases of 3-5 degrees represent significant clinical improvement.
          </p>

          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> On your monthly side-view photo, draw a vertical plumb line from ear canal 
            downward. In good posture, this line should pass through the middle of the shoulder. Measure horizontal 
            distance between plumb line and shoulder center.
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>What it means:</strong> Forward head posture is often accompanied by rounded shoulders. As neck 
            posture improves, shoulders should move back toward proper alignment. Track both neck and shoulder changes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Why it works:</strong> Neck and shoulder posture are interconnected. Tracking both provides 
            comprehensive view of upper body alignment improvements.

          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to track:</strong> Daily pain log using 0-10 scale for different types:
            <ul className="ml-4 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>• Upper neck pain</li>

            </ul>
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Track patterns:</strong> Note time of day pain is worst, activities that trigger it, duration of 
            pain episodes. Look for trends over weeks/months.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Expected progress:</strong> Pain often improves before visual changes. Many people see 30-50% pain 
            reduction in first 6-8 weeks, even with minimal visible posture change.

          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to test (weekly):</strong> Stand or sit with perfect posture (shoulders back, head aligned). 
            Time how long you can maintain this position before discomfort forces you to relax. Record time in minutes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Starting baseline:</strong> Many people with forward head posture can maintain good posture for only 
            30 seconds to 2 minutes initially. This fatigues weakened postural muscles.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Expected progress:</strong> Posture endurance typically increases 30-60 seconds per month with 
            consistent exercise. Ability to maintain good posture for 10+ minutes indicates significant strength improvement.
          </p>

          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Movements to test (weekly):</strong>
            <ul className="ml-4 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>• Neck rotation: Turn head left/right, estimate degrees or use landmarks ("can see behind shoulder")</li>
              <li>• Neck lateral flexion: Tilt ear toward shoulder, measure distance from ear to shoulder tip</li>
              <li>• Neck extension: Look up at ceiling, note comfort level and range achieved</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Expected progress:</strong> Range of motion often decreases initially (tighter as you strengthen 
            weak muscles), then increases beyond baseline by months 3-6. This is normal and expected.
          </p>

        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">4. Exercise Progression Log</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>What to track:</strong> For each exercise, record reps, sets, hold times, resistance level (if 
            applicable). Note when you increase difficulty or add new exercises.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Example entry:</strong> "Week 8: Chin tucks - 3 sets x 12 reps, 5-second holds. Up from 3x8 last month. 
            Shoulders staying relaxed, no pain. Ready to try resistance band variation next week."
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Exercise progression is itself a progress marker. If you're consistently 
            advancing exercise difficulty, your muscles are strengthening even if visual changes lag.

    {
      question: "How often should I take progress photos?",
      answer: "Monthly is optimal. Weekly or daily photos show no visible change and cause discouragement. Monthly intervals (same day each month) provide enough time to see small but real improvements. Always use exact same conditions: location, lighting, clothing, camera distance."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the most important metric to track?",
      answer: "Wall test distance (measured weekly) combined with monthly photos. Wall test provides objective quantitative data sensitive to small changes. Photos provide visual motivation and show changes your brain can't detect day-to-day. Together, these capture both objective and subjective progress."
    },
    {
      question: "How long before I see measurable progress?",
      answer: "Functional improvements (reduced pain, better posture endurance): 4-6 weeks. Measurable improvements (wall test distance, CVA): 6-8 weeks. Visual improvements noticeable in photos: 8-12 weeks. Significant visual transformation: 4-6 months. Be patient - progress is gradual but real."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my measurements aren't improving but I feel better?",
      answer: "This is common and still represents real progress. Functional improvements (less pain, better endurance, easier daily activities) often precede measurable structural changes. Continue your program - visual and measurement changes will follow. Feeling better is the most important outcome."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I compare my progress to other people's before/after photos?",
      answer: "No - only compare to YOUR baseline. Age, severity, consistency, genetics, and lifestyle factors all affect progress rate. Some people see dramatic changes in 3 months, others need 12+ months. Focus on YOUR progress trajectory, not others' timelines. Forward movement is success."
