      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Plateaus Are Normal and Expected</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Neck hump correction is not a linear process. Progress follows a pattern of rapid improvement, followed by 
        plateaus where visible changes stall, followed by another period of improvement. This "staircase pattern" is 
        completely normal and reflects how your body adapts to exercise. During plateaus, your nervous system is 
        consolidating motor patterns, muscles are remodeling, and connective tissue is adapting - even though you can't 
        see external changes.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Understanding that plateaus are an expected part of the process (not signs of failure) is crucial for maintaining 
        motivation. Most people experience 2-3 significant plateaus during the first 6 months of correction. These typically 
        occur around weeks 8-10, weeks 16-18, and months 4-5. Each plateau lasts 2-4 weeks on average before progress 
        resumes. Knowing this pattern helps you maintain perspective when it happens to you.

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">1. Adaptation Plateau (Most Common)</h4>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>What it is:</strong> After 6-10 weeks of consistent exercise, your body fully adapts to your current 
            routine. Exercises that were challenging become easy, but visual progress stalls. Measurements show minimal 
            change for 2-4 weeks.
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why it happens:</strong> Your nervous system has learned current movement patterns. Muscles have adapted 
            to current demands. You need new stimulus to trigger further improvement.
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm">
            <strong>How to break through:</strong> Add new exercises, increase difficulty of current exercises (more reps, 
            longer holds, resistance bands), or modify exercise tempo. New stimulus reignites progress within 2-3 weeks.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">2. Lifestyle-Induced Setback</h4>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>What it is:</strong> Temporary regression in posture and/or pain from life disruptions: increased work 
            stress, poor sleep week, illness, travel, family crisis. May lose 1-2 weeks of progress.
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why it happens:</strong> Stress increases muscle tension (especially upper traps). Poor sleep impairs 
            recovery. Illness diverts bodily resources away from muscle building. Travel disrupts exercise routine and 
            often involves poor ergonomics (planes, hotels).
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm">
            <strong>How to handle:</strong> Accept temporary regression without guilt. Resume normal routine when life 
            stabilizes. You'll regain lost ground within 1-2 weeks. These setbacks don't erase months of progress - just 
            temporary blips.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">3. Overtraining Plateau</h4>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>What it is:</strong> Progress stalls and fatigue increases because you're doing TOO MUCH. Pain may 
            worsen, motivation drops, exercises feel harder instead of easier.
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why it happens:</strong> Enthusiastic people often dramatically increase exercise volume when they see 
            initial progress. Muscles need recovery time. Overtraining causes chronic fatigue that impairs further adaptation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm">
            <strong>How to break through:</strong> Take 5-7 day complete rest break. Resume at 70% of previous volume. 
            Paradoxically, reducing volume often reignites progress because muscles finally get needed recovery.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">4. Psychological Plateau (Perception vs Reality)</h4>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>What it is:</strong> ACTUAL progress is occurring (measurements improving), but you FEEL like you're 
            plateaued because changes are subtle and your brain adapts to gradual improvements.
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why it happens:</strong> Your brain normalizes your current appearance quickly. You see yourself daily, 
            so gradual changes become invisible. This is why progress photos are critical - they show objective improvement 
            your brain can't perceive.
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm">
            <strong>How to handle:</strong> Compare current month photos to month 0, not to last month. Review measurement 
            data objectively. Ask trusted friend who hasn't seen you in 2 months - they'll likely comment on improvements 
            you can't see.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">5. Seasonal Setback</h4>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>What it is:</strong> Temporary worsening during seasonal changes - often winter months or high-stress 
            periods (holidays, tax season, etc.). Posture and pain regress slightly.
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why it happens:</strong> Cold weather increases muscle tension. Less daylight affects mood and motivation. 
            Holiday stress, travel, and schedule disruptions interfere with exercise consistency. Seasonal depression 
            reduces exercise adherence.
          </p>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm">
            <strong>How to handle:</strong> Recognize pattern (happens every winter/summer/holiday season). Plan ahead with 
            mini-routine for busy periods. Accept 80% compliance during tough seasons rather than all-or-nothing thinking. 
            Progress resumes when season passes.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Strategies to Break Through Plateaus</h3>
      
      <div className="space-y-4 mb-6">
        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">1. Add Progressive Resistance</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to implement:</strong> Add resistance bands to chin tucks, hold light weights (2.5-5 lbs) during 
            scapular exercises, increase isometric hold times from 5 to 8-10 seconds.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Why it works:</strong> Progressive overload is fundamental to continued adaptation. Once bodyweight 
            exercises become easy, external resistance provides new stimulus. Start very light - even 2-3 lbs makes significant 
            difference.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">2. Introduce New Exercise Variations</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Examples:</strong> If doing basic chin tucks, progress to wall-supported chin tucks or resistance band 
            chin tucks. Add Y-T-W raises if only doing scapular squeezes. Try wall angels if currently doing simpler exercises.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Why it works:</strong> Different exercises target same muscles from different angles, recruiting dormant 
            motor units. Variety prevents neural adaptation that causes plateaus.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">3. Address Ergonomic Factors</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Audit your environment:</strong> Workstation setup, car seat position, sleep pillow height, phone/tablet 
            use habits. Often, exercise progress plateaus because daily habits are working against you 8-12 hours daily.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Why it matters:</strong> You can't out-exercise 8 hours of terrible desk ergonomics. Fixing environmental 
            factors often breaks plateaus that exercise progression alone cannot.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">4. Take Strategic Rest Week</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Protocol:</strong> Take complete week off from all neck exercises. Maintain general activity (walking, 
            light movement) but no targeted neck work. Resume after 7 days at 80-90% of previous volume.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Why it works:</strong> Chronic low-grade fatigue accumulates over months. Week off allows complete 
            recovery. Many people find they return stronger and progress resumes. This is "deload week" concept from strength 
            training.
          </p>

        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">5. Work with Physical Therapist</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>When to seek help:</strong> If plateau lasts longer than 6-8 weeks despite trying other strategies, or 
            if you're unsure how to progress exercises safely.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Why it helps:</strong> PT can identify subtle form issues, muscle imbalances, or missing exercises in 
            your routine. Often, 2-3 sessions provide insights that break months-long plateaus. Fresh professional perspective 
            reveals blind spots.

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Doubling or tripling reps/frequency rarely breaks plateaus and often causes injury. Muscles need recovery, not 
            more volume. Increase by 10-20% maximum, or better yet, add resistance/difficulty rather than volume.

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Plateaus feel like failure but are normal adaptation phases. Most people quit during second or third plateau 
            (months 3-5), right before breakthrough would occur. Persistence through plateaus separates long-term success from failure.

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Age, genetics, severity, consistency, and lifestyle factors all affect progress rate. Someone else's 3-month 
            transformation means nothing for YOUR timeline. Focus on your own trajectory, not others' highlight reels.

  const faqQuestions = [
    {
      question: "How long do plateaus typically last?",
      answer: "Most plateaus last 2-4 weeks. First plateau (weeks 8-10) usually breaks within 2-3 weeks with exercise progression. Second plateau (weeks 16-18) may last 3-4 weeks. Extended plateau at months 4-5 can last 4-6 weeks but breaks dramatically once it does. Plateaus longer than 8 weeks suggest need for professional evaluation."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it normal to regress temporarily during high-stress periods?",
      answer: "Absolutely yes. Stress increases muscle tension (especially upper traps), disrupts sleep (impairs recovery), and often interferes with exercise consistency. Temporary 1-2 week regression during stress is completely normal. Resume normal routine when stress resolves and you'll regain lost ground quickly."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I change my entire program if I hit a plateau?",
      answer: "No - don't throw out entire program. Make targeted modifications: add resistance to 1-2 exercises, introduce 1-2 new exercises, increase difficulty of 1-2 current exercises. Wholesale program changes prevent body from fully adapting and often restart progress from zero. Small strategic changes work better."
    },
    {
      question: "Why do I feel like I've plateaued but measurements show improvement?",
      answer: "This is psychological plateau - very common. Your brain adapts to gradual changes and normalizes your appearance. Measurements reveal objective progress your brain can't perceive. Trust the data over your perception. Compare month 0 vs current photos - improvement will be obvious."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I've tried everything and still can't break through plateau?",
      answer: "After 8 weeks of plateau despite trying: exercise progression, rest week, ergonomic adjustments, and new exercises - schedule PT evaluation. You likely have subtle form issue, muscle imbalance, or missing exercise component that professional assessment will identify. Most persistent plateaus break within 2-3 sessions of PT."
