  const shortAnswer = "Severe neck hump correction typically takes 6-12 months with consistent exercise and lifestyle changes. You may see initial improvements in 4-8 weeks, but significant structural changes require 3-6 months. Complete correction of severe cases may take 12-18 months. Progress is gradual and requires patience and consistency."

      title: "Severity Determines Timeline",
      content: "Mild cases may improve in 2-4 months, moderate cases in 4-8 months, and severe cases in 6-12 months or longer. The more pronounced the hump and the longer it's been present, the more time correction will take."
    },
    {
      title: "Age and Health Factors",
      content: "Younger people (under 40) typically see faster results due to better tissue flexibility and healing capacity. Older adults or those with medical conditions may need longer timelines. Overall health and fitness level significantly impact recovery speed."
    },
    {
      title: "Consistency is Critical",
      content: "Progress depends heavily on consistent daily exercise and lifestyle modifications. Missing weeks of exercise can significantly delay progress. Those who maintain consistent routines see 2-3x faster improvement than those with irregular practice."
    },
    {
      title: "Expect Plateaus and Setbacks",
      content: "Progress is rarely linear. You'll have periods of rapid improvement followed by plateaus. This is normal and doesn't mean you're not making progress. Stay consistent through these phases."

  const faqData = [
    {
      question: "How long does it take to fix a severe neck hump?",
      answer: "Severe neck hump correction typically takes 6-12 months with consistent exercise and lifestyle changes. You may see initial improvements in 4-8 weeks, but significant structural changes require 3-6 months. Complete correction of severe cases may take 12-18 months depending on individual factors."
    },
    {
      question: "What factors affect how long neck hump correction takes?",
      answer: "Key factors include severity of the hump, how long it's been present, age, overall health, consistency of exercise, lifestyle factors (work ergonomics, sleep position), and any underlying medical conditions. Younger, healthier individuals with mild cases typically see faster results."
    },
    {
      question: "Can severe neck hump be completely corrected?",
      answer: "Most severe neck humps can be significantly improved (60-80% correction) with consistent exercise and lifestyle changes. Complete correction depends on individual factors, but even partial improvement can dramatically reduce pain and improve appearance and function."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't see improvement after 3 months?",
      answer: "If you haven't seen any improvement after 3 months of consistent exercise, consider consulting a physical therapist or healthcare provider. You may need professional assessment, different exercise approaches, or evaluation for underlying conditions that might be affecting progress."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it normal to have setbacks during neck hump correction?",
      answer: "Yes, setbacks are normal and expected. You may have periods of rapid improvement followed by plateaus, or temporary worsening due to stress, illness, or changes in routine. The key is to stay consistent and not get discouraged by temporary setbacks."
