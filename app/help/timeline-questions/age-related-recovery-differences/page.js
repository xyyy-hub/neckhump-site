      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How Age Affects Tissue Adaptation and Recovery</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Age profoundly influences how quickly your body responds to posture correction exercises. Younger tissues have 
        higher cell turnover rates, better collagen synthesis, faster neuromuscular adaptation, and superior recovery capacity. 
        As we age, several physiological changes slow the correction process: decreased muscle protein synthesis, reduced 
        collagen production, longer tissue recovery times, higher baseline inflammation, and decreased proprioception.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        However - and this is critical - age does NOT determine whether you CAN improve, only HOW LONG it takes and what 
        modifications are needed. Studies consistently show older adults (60s-80s) can significantly improve posture with 
        appropriate exercise programs. The key is adjusting expectations and methods to match your age-specific physiology. 
        A 25-year-old and 65-year-old doing the same program will see vastly different timelines, but both can achieve 
        meaningful improvement.

          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Advantages:</strong> Peak tissue adaptability, rapid neuromuscular learning, minimal concurrent health

          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Challenges:</strong> Lower motivation (appearance less priority than older adults), lifestyle factors

      question: "Can I still fix my neck hump in my 60s or 70s?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely. Older adults can achieve significant functional improvements (50-70% pain reduction, better balance, maintained independence) even if visual correction is more modest (20-40%). Studies show people in their 70s and 80s benefit from appropriate exercise programs. The key is realistic expectations: focus on function over appearance, use appropriate modifications, and expect longer timelines (9-12+ months)."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does age slow down posture correction?",
      answer: "Multiple physiological changes: decreased muscle protein synthesis (slower muscle building), reduced collagen production (slower tissue remodeling), longer recovery times between sessions, higher baseline inflammation, decreased proprioception (body awareness), and often concurrent conditions like arthritis or osteoporosis. These factors don't prevent improvement - they just slow the timeline and require modifications."
    },
    {
      question: "Should older adults do the same exercises as younger people?",
      answer: "No - older adults need modifications: seated exercises with back support (not standing), longer recovery between sessions (2-3 days minimum), gentler intensity (30-50% effort), slower progressions (every 6-8 weeks vs 2-3 weeks), emphasis on isometric exercises, and medical clearance before starting. Same principles apply, but execution must match age-related physiology."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it worth trying to fix posture if I'm over 70?",
      answer: "Absolutely yes. Even modest improvements provide major quality of life benefits: reduced pain (huge impact on daily function), better balance (reduces fall risk), maintained independence (can continue activities of daily living), improved breathing and digestion. Visual correction is bonus - functional gains are what matter most and these ARE achievable at any age."
    },
    {
      question: "Do younger people have better outcomes than older people?",
      answer: "Younger people see faster visual changes (2-4 months vs 9-12 months) and often achieve more complete structural correction (80-95% vs 20-40%). However, older adults often achieve BETTER functional outcomes because they're more consistent, motivated, and patient. They also appreciate improvements more. Success isn't just appearance - it's function, pain reduction, and quality of life."
