      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Detailed Timeline Breakdown</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The timeline for neck hump improvement varies significantly based on factors like severity, consistency, age, 
        and underlying causes. However, most people follow a predictable pattern of recovery when following a proper 
        exercise routine.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Week 1-2: Initial Changes</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        During the first two weeks, you'll likely notice:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Reduced neck and shoulder stiffness</li>
        <li>Less tension headaches</li>
        <li>Improved range of motion</li>
        <li>Better awareness of your posture</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Week 3-6: Visible Improvement</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Around week 4-6, you should start seeing:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Visible reduction in the neck hump when viewed from the side</li>
        <li>Stronger deep neck flexor muscles</li>
        <li>Less forward head posture throughout the day</li>
        <li>Improved ability to maintain good posture for longer periods</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Week 8-12: Significant Change</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        By 8-12 weeks of consistent practice:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Substantial reduction in neck hump appearance</li>
        <li>Automatic posture correction habits</li>
        <li>Reduced neck and upper back pain</li>
        <li>Improved overall spinal alignment</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Factors That Affect Timeline</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Several factors influence how quickly you'll see improvement:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Severity:</strong> Mild cases improve faster than severe, long-standing humps</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Daily practice is crucial - skipping days significantly slows progress</li>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> Younger people typically see faster results due to better tissue healing</li>
        <li><strong>Underlying causes:</strong> Structural issues may require longer treatment</li>
        <li><strong>Lifestyle factors:</strong> Desk work, phone use, and sleep position affect progress</li>
      </ul>

    {
      question: "Why am I not seeing improvement after 4 weeks?",
      answer: "This is normal for some people. Factors like severity, age, consistency, and underlying causes affect timeline. Take progress photos and consider consulting a physical therapist if no improvement after 8 weeks."

    {
      question: "Can neck hump be completely fixed?",
      answer: "Most mild to moderate neck humps can be significantly improved or completely corrected with consistent exercise. Severe, long-standing cases may require longer treatment or professional intervention."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I exercise to see results?",
      answer: "Daily exercise for 10-15 minutes is ideal. Consistency is more important than intensity - 5 minutes daily is better than 30 minutes once a week."

    {
      question: "What if I miss a few days of exercises?",
      answer: "Missing a few days won't ruin your progress, but consistency is key. Try to maintain at least 5 days per week. If you miss more than a week, you may need to restart with easier exercises."
