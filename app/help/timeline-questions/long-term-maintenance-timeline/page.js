      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Understanding the Three Phases of Posture Correction</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Neck hump correction isn't a temporary fix you do once and forget - it's a three-phase journey: active correction, 
        transition, and lifelong maintenance. Understanding these phases prevents the common mistake of achieving improvement, 
        stopping exercises, and regressing back to baseline within months. Think of posture correction like physical fitness: 
        you don't get fit once and stay fit forever without ongoing effort. The good news? Maintenance requires significantly 
        less time and effort than the initial correction phase.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The fundamental challenge: Modern lifestyle (desk work, phones, driving) constantly promotes forward head posture. 
        If the original cause still exists (8 hours daily poor ergonomics), stopping corrective exercises means old patterns 
        eventually return. However, with proper maintenance strategy (2-3x/week, 10-15 min), you can permanently sustain 
        improvements while living normal modern life.

          <li>• <strong>Success predictors:</strong> Habit integration, ergonomic improvements, accountability systems 
          (reminders, tracking), realistic expectations about lifelong need</li>
          <li>• <strong>Failure predictors:</strong> All-or-nothing thinking ("If I can't do 5x/week, I won't do anything"),

      question: "What happens if I take a break for vacation or illness?",
      answer: "Short breaks (1-3 weeks) typically cause minimal regression. Resume at previous frequency when able. Breaks 4+ weeks start showing measurable regression. After extended break (illness, surgery), treat as transition phase redux - start at 60-70% previous intensity, rebuild gradually over 2-3 weeks before resuming full maintenance."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I reduce maintenance frequency over time?",
      answer: "Some people successfully reduce from 3x/week to 2x/week after years of consistent maintenance, especially if they've improved ergonomics or added complementary activities (yoga, Pilates). Test reductions gradually (every 6-12 months) while monitoring measurements. However, many people find their minimum effective dose and stay there indefinitely."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there any way to 'cure' this permanently without maintenance?",
      answer: "Only if you eliminate the root cause entirely. If you transition from 8-hour desk job to fully active lifestyle, significantly improve all ergonomics, AND maintain general fitness with posture-supporting activities, you might reduce maintenance to occasional tune-ups. But most people in modern life need ongoing maintenance because lifestyle constantly promotes forward posture."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I stay motivated for long-term maintenance?",
      answer: "Key strategies: 1) Link to existing habits (automatic triggers), 2) Track quarterly measurements (seeing sustained results is motivating), 3) Remember regression timeline (knowing you'll lose progress in 6-8 weeks motivates consistency), 4) Keep maintenance short (10-15 min is sustainable long-term), 5) Focus on benefits beyond appearance (pain relief, energy, function), 6) Occasional photos comparing current vs pre-correction (visual reminder of progress)."
