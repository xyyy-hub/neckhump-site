  const shortAnswer = "Forward head posture after whiplash requires a gentle, progressive approach starting 1-2 weeks after injury. Begin with very gentle range-of-motion exercises, then gradually add isometric strengthening. Avoid aggressive stretching or rapid movements. Recovery typically takes 6-12 weeks, but severe cases may require 3-6 months."

    {
      title: "Whiplash Severity Determines Approach",
      content: "Grade 1 (mild) whiplash may allow gentle posture exercises within 1-2 weeks. Grade 2-3 (moderate to severe) may require 2-4 weeks before starting. Grade 4 (severe) may need 4-6 weeks or longer. Always follow your healthcare provider's specific timeline."
    },
    {
      title: "Pain is Your Guide",
      content: "Exercises should cause minimal to no pain. If an exercise increases your pain significantly or causes pain that lasts more than 2 hours after exercise, you've overdone it. Pain that worsens over time indicates you need to reduce intensity or stop certain exercises."
    },
    {
      title: "Muscle Guarding is Common",
      content: "After whiplash, muscles often 'guard' or tighten to protect injured tissues. This can contribute to forward head posture. Gentle exercises help reduce guarding while strengthening supporting muscles. Don't force movements through muscle tension."
    },
    {
      title: "Recovery is Not Linear",
      content: "You'll have good days and bad days. It's normal to need to reduce exercise intensity during flare-ups. Don't push through significant pain - this can delay healing and worsen your condition."

        "Add shoulder blade squeezes",

      question: "When can I start correcting forward head posture after whiplash?",
      answer: "Most healthcare providers recommend starting gentle posture exercises 1-2 weeks after whiplash injury, but this depends on severity. Grade 1 (mild) whiplash may allow exercises within 1-2 weeks, while severe cases may require 4-6 weeks. Always follow your healthcare provider's specific recommendations."
    },
    {
      question: "What exercises should I avoid after whiplash?",
      answer: "Avoid rapid head movements, aggressive stretching, heavy resistance exercises, and any movements that cause sharp pain or increase your symptoms. Also avoid exercises that require you to hold your head in extreme positions or that cause dizziness or nausea."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to correct posture after whiplash?",
      answer: "Posture correction after whiplash typically takes 6-12 weeks for mild to moderate cases, but severe cases may require 3-6 months. The timeline depends on injury severity, your adherence to exercises, and individual healing factors. Be patient and consistent with your recovery program."
    },
    {
      question: "Can forward head posture exercises make whiplash worse?",
      answer: "Improper or aggressive exercises can worsen whiplash symptoms and delay healing. However, appropriate, gentle exercises can actually speed recovery by maintaining range of motion, reducing muscle guarding, and strengthening supporting muscles. The key is starting slowly and progressing gradually."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I still have posture problems after 3 months?",
      answer: "If you still have significant posture problems after 3 months, you may have chronic whiplash and should consult with a healthcare provider. You may need additional treatment such as physical therapy, massage therapy, or other interventions. Don't try to push through persistent problems."
