      <p className="mb-4">
        Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a group of genetic connective tissue disorders affecting collagen production. 
        Collagen provides structure and strength to skin, joints, blood vessels, and organs. In EDS, defective collagen 
        causes joint hypermobility (excessive range of motion), skin hyperextensibility, tissue fragility, and chronic pain. 
        The most common type affecting posture is Hypermobile EDS (hEDS), characterized primarily by joint hypermobility 
        and chronic pain.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Here's the exercise paradox: Most posture programs focus on improving flexibility and range of motion. EDS patients 
        have TOO MUCH range of motion already. Your joints are unstable because ligaments are too loose. Forward head posture 
        in EDS often results from poor muscular control of hypermobile cervical joints, not stiffness. Therefore, EDS neck 
        exercises must focus on stabilization, strengthening in neutral positions, and LIMITING range of motion - the complete 
        opposite of standard programs.
      </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">1. Joint Hypermobility vs. Instability</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            EDS joints move through excessive range (hypermobility) but lack control (instability). Cervical vertebrae may 
            partially dislocate (subluxate) during normal movements. Exercise must build muscular control to stabilize joints, 
            not increase flexibility further.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">2. Proprioceptive Deficits</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            EDS patients often have poor proprioception (sense of joint position). You might not feel when joints are at 
            end-range or subluxating until pain occurs. This makes traditional "move until you feel stretch" instructions 
            dangerous - you need to stop well before end-range.

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">3. Chronic Pain and Fatigue</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Managing unstable joints is exhausting. EDS causes chronic pain and fatigue similar to fibromyalgia. Exercise 
            protocols must account for limited energy and pain sensitivity, using minimal volume.
          </p>

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            EDS muscles, tendons, and ligaments are more prone to injury. High-repetition exercises or end-range positions 
            can cause tissue damage. Conservative volume and intensity are essential.

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Some EDS patients (especially with classical or vascular subtypes) have craniocervical instability (CCI) - 
            excessive movement between skull and upper cervical spine. This is dangerous and requires specialized assessment 
            before ANY neck exercises.

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">1. Mid-Range Isometric Neck Strengthening (Safest for EDS)</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Sit with good neck support (high-backed chair or travel neck pillow). Ensure 
            head is in NEUTRAL position - not forward, back, or tilted. Place palm on forehead. Push head forward at only 
            30-40% effort while resisting - head should NOT move AT ALL. Hold 3-4 seconds. Rest 15 seconds. Do 3-5 reps. 
            Repeat with hand on back of head, then each side. 2-3x per week MAXIMUM.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why safest for EDS:</strong> NO movement means no joint stress or subluxation risk. Building strength 
            in neutral position improves joint stability. Low reps prevent tissue fatigue/injury.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>CRITICAL:</strong> Do these in NEUTRAL only, never in tilted or rotated positions which increase 
            instability. If joint "feels wrong" or you get sudden sharp pain, stop immediately - this suggests subluxation.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">2. Limited-Range Chin Tucks with External Support</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Sit in high-backed chair with head resting against backrest. Optional: wear soft 
            cervical collar or use folded towel for additional support. Gently pull chin back only 20-30% of full range 
            (barely noticeable movement). Hold 2-3 seconds only. Do 5-6 reps maximum, 2-3x per week.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why limited range:</strong> Full-range chin tucks can stress hypermobile cervical joints. Minimal 
            movement provides strengthening benefit without joint stress. External support provides stability.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Skip if:</strong> This causes neck pain, clicking, or "grinding" sensations. These suggest joint 
            irritation or subluxation. Isometric exercises are safer alternative.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">3. Scapular Stabilization (Critical for EDS)</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Sit with back supported. Gently squeeze shoulder blades together at 40-50% effort, 
            BUT focus on HOLDING the position steadily rather than squeezing hard. Hold 5-6 seconds with focus on control. 
            Do 6-8 reps, 2-3x per week.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why critical for EDS:</strong> Scapular stability provides a stable base for neck. EDS patients often 
            have shoulder instability contributing to neck problems. This addresses root cause without stressing cervical joints.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Focus on quality:</strong> Smooth, controlled movement matters more than strength. If shoulders feel 
            unstable or you can't hold position steadily, reduce effort to 30% and focus on control.
          </p>

        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">

          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Stand with back against wall (or sit in high-backed chair). Align head, upper 
            back, and lower back against support. Focus on HOLDING this position with minimal effort for 20-30 seconds. 
            Do 3-4 times daily if tolerated.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why wall support:</strong> External support prevents hyperextension and provides proprioceptive feedback. 
            Builds postural endurance without requiring joint control in unsupported positions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Modification:</strong> If standing is fatiguing or causes POTS symptoms (common in EDS), do this sitting 
            only. Effect is similar.

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            NEVER do neck stretches. Your joints are already hypermobile. Stretching makes instability worse and increases 
            subluxation risk. If a provider recommends stretching without understanding EDS, find an EDS-knowledgeable provider.

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Don't do exercises that take joints to end-range (maximum rotation, flexion, or extension). Stop all movements 
            at 70-80% of available range. End-range positions stress already-loose ligaments.

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Avoid 15-20+ repetition ranges. EDS tissues fatigue quickly, losing stabilization ability. Stick to 5-8 reps

            Pain in EDS often indicates tissue damage or joint subluxation. Stop exercises immediately if pain occurs.

      question: "Why should I avoid stretching if I have EDS?",
      answer: "EDS causes joint hypermobility - your joints already move too much due to loose ligaments. Stretching further loosens these structures, worsening instability and increasing subluxation risk. You need stabilization (strengthening muscles to control excessive range), not more flexibility. This is the opposite of most posture programs."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if I'm exercising to end-range with EDS?",
      answer: "Poor proprioception in EDS makes this hard to judge. Use external cues: stop movements at 70-80% of what you think is your maximum range. Use mirror for visual feedback. If exercises cause joint clicking, grinding, or 'wrong' feelings, you're going too far. When in doubt, err on side of less range."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do yoga or Pilates with EDS?",
      answer: "Only with major modifications. Standard yoga/Pilates emphasize end-range flexibility - terrible for EDS. You need instructor specifically trained in hypermobility modifications who focuses on stabilization, not flexibility. Most yoga/Pilates classes will worsen EDS. Modified, supervised sessions can be helpful."
    },
    {
      question: "What is craniocervical instability and do I need to worry about it?",
      answer: "CCI is excessive movement between skull and upper cervical spine, occurring in some EDS patients (especially classical/vascular types). Symptoms: severe head/neck pain, difficulty holding head up, neurological symptoms, worsening with neck positions. If you have these, get evaluated with specialized imaging (flexion/extension MRI) before ANY neck exercises."
    },
    {
      question: "Will exercises eventually make my EDS joints more stable?",
      answer: "Exercises can improve muscular control and functional stability, reducing subluxation frequency and pain. However, you can't change your loose ligaments - EDS is genetic. Exercises provide better management, not cure. You'll need to continue stabilization exercises lifelong to maintain benefits."
