  const shortAnswer = "Forward head posture can be corrected with arthritis, but requires gentle, modified approaches. Focus on isometric exercises, gentle range-of-motion, and postural awareness rather than aggressive stretching. Work with a physical therapist to develop a safe, progressive program that doesn't worsen joint inflammation."

      title: "Arthritis Affects Joint Mobility",
      content: "Arthritis can limit neck range of motion and make certain positions painful. Focus on exercises that work within your comfortable range rather than trying to force normal range of motion. Small improvements are still valuable."
    },
    {
      title: "Pain Management is Priority",
      content: "Never push through significant pain. Use heat before exercises to improve flexibility, and ice after if needed. If an exercise consistently causes pain that lasts more than 2 hours, modify or eliminate it."
    },
    {
      title: "Strengthening vs Stretching",
      content: "With arthritis, strengthening exercises are often more beneficial than aggressive stretching. Focus on isometric exercises and gentle resistance work to build supporting muscle strength without stressing joints."
    },
    {
      title: "Postural Awareness is Key",
      content: "Developing awareness of your forward head posture throughout the day is often more important than specific exercises. Use reminders, ergonomic adjustments, and frequent posture checks to maintain better alignment."

        "Hold for 5 seconds, then relax",
        "Repeat with hand on back of head, then each side",

      question: "Can I fix forward head posture if I have arthritis?",
      answer: "Yes, you can improve forward head posture with arthritis, but it requires a gentle, modified approach. Focus on isometric exercises, postural awareness, and strengthening rather than aggressive stretching. Work with a physical therapist to develop a safe program that doesn't worsen joint inflammation."
    },
    {
      question: "What exercises should I avoid with arthritis and forward head posture?",
      answer: "Avoid rapid head movements, aggressive stretching, heavy resistance exercises, and any movements that cause sharp pain or increase stiffness. Also avoid exercises that require you to hold your head in extreme positions for extended periods."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see improvement with arthritis?",
      answer: "Improvement with arthritis may be slower than in healthy individuals. You might see small improvements in 2-4 weeks, but significant changes may take 2-3 months. Focus on maintaining current function and preventing further deterioration rather than dramatic improvements."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I use heat or ice for forward head posture with arthritis?",
      answer: "Use heat for 10-15 minutes before exercises to improve flexibility and reduce stiffness. Use ice after exercises if you experience increased pain or inflammation. Some people find alternating heat and ice helpful for managing arthritis symptoms."
    },
    {
      question: "Can ergonomic changes help with forward head posture and arthritis?",
      answer: "Yes, ergonomic adjustments are crucial for managing forward head posture with arthritis. Proper computer monitor height, supportive chairs, and frequent position changes can reduce strain on arthritic joints and help maintain better posture throughout the day."
