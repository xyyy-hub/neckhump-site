  const shortAnswer = "Yes, you can do neck exercises with arthritis, but they must be modified to avoid joint stress. Focus on gentle range-of-motion exercises, isometric strengthening, and posture awareness. Avoid aggressive stretching or high-impact movements that could worsen inflammation. Start with 5-10 minutes daily and gradually increase as tolerated."

      title: "Arthritis Type Matters",

      title: "Timing is Important",

      question: "Can neck exercises make arthritis worse?",
      answer: "Improper or aggressive neck exercises can worsen arthritis symptoms. However, gentle, modified exercises can actually help by maintaining range of motion, reducing stiffness, and strengthening supporting muscles. The key is starting slowly and listening to your body."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I do neck exercises with arthritis?",
      answer: "Start with 5-10 minutes daily, focusing on gentle range-of-motion exercises. During flare-ups, reduce frequency or intensity. On good days, you can do exercises twice daily. Consistency is more important than intensity."
    },
    {
      question: "What exercises should I avoid with neck arthritis?",
      answer: "Avoid rapid head movements, aggressive stretching, heavy resistance exercises, and any movements that cause sharp pain. Also avoid exercises that require you to hold your head in extreme positions for extended periods."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I exercise during an arthritis flare-up?",
      answer: "During active flare-ups, focus on very gentle range-of-motion exercises only. Avoid strengthening exercises and any movements that increase pain. If even gentle movement is painful, rest and consult your healthcare provider."
    },
    {
      question: "Can posture exercises help with arthritis pain?",
      answer: "Yes, improving posture can reduce strain on arthritic joints and may help decrease pain. Good posture distributes weight more evenly and reduces stress on specific joints. However, posture changes should be gradual and comfortable."
