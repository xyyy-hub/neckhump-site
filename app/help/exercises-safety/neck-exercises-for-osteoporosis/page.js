      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Understanding Osteoporosis and Neck Exercise Safety</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Osteoporosis causes bones to become weak and brittle, making them more susceptible to fractures. The cervical 
        spine (neck) is particularly vulnerable because of its mobility and the weight it supports. Compression fractures 
        in the cervical spine can occur from seemingly minor incidents or even forward-bending movements in severe cases. 
        This makes exercise selection critically important.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        However, appropriate exercise is essential for osteoporosis management. Properly selected neck exercises can 
        strengthen the muscles supporting your cervical spine, improve posture, reduce fall risk, and potentially slow 
        bone density loss. The key is choosing exercises that build strength without putting excessive compression or 
        bending stress on weakened bones.

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">1. Compression Fracture Risk</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Forward bending (flexion) of the spine increases pressure on the front of vertebrae, where osteoporotic 
            bones are weakest. Even 50 pounds of force can cause compression fractures in severe osteoporosis.

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Osteoporosis often affects balance and coordination. Exercises must account for increased fall risk, 
            as falls can cause catastrophic fractures in multiple sites.

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Many osteoporosis patients have undiagnosed compression fractures. Exercise must be conservative enough 
            not to worsen existing damage while still providing strengthening benefits.

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">1. Isometric Neck Exercises (Best for Osteoporosis)</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Sit upright with good posture. Place your palm against your forehead. 
            Push your head forward INTO your hand while resisting with your hand - your head shouldn't move. Hold 
            for 6 seconds. Repeat with hand on back of head, then each side. Do 5 reps each direction.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Why it's safe:</strong> No movement means no compression forces on vertebrae. Builds neck strength 
            without fracture risk. This is the SAFEST exercise for osteoporosis patients.
          </p>

          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Sit upright against a wall or high-backed chair. Gently pull your chin 
            straight back (creating a "double chin"), keeping your head level - DO NOT look down or tuck your chin 
            to your chest. Hold for 3-5 seconds. Repeat 10 times.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Why it's safe:</strong> The backward movement (extension) is safer than forward bending. Using 
            a wall for support prevents excessive movement. Improves posture without compression forces.
          </p>
        </div>

          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Sit or stand upright. Gently squeeze your shoulder blades together as if 
            holding a pencil between them. Hold for 5-6 seconds, then release slowly. Repeat 10-15 times.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Why it's safe:</strong> Strengthens upper back muscles that support neck posture without putting 
            any force on cervical vertebrae. Helps prevent forward-head posture that increases fracture risk.

          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Stand with your back against a wall, heels 3-4 inches from the wall. 
            Press your lower back, upper back, and head against the wall. Hold for 10 seconds, breathing normally. 
            Repeat 5-10 times.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Why it's safe:</strong> Wall provides support and prevents excessive movement. Encourages proper 
            alignment without loading the spine. Builds postural endurance.

          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Sit upright with good support. Slowly turn your head to look over your 
            right shoulder, moving only 30-45 degrees (not full rotation). Hold for 3-5 seconds. Return to center. 
            Repeat on left side. Do 5 reps each side.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Why it's safe:</strong> Limited range prevents excessive torque on cervical spine. Maintains 
            functional mobility without fracture risk. Must be done gently and slowly.

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Do NOT do exercises that bend your head forward significantly (looking down at floor, bringing chin to chest). 
            This creates dangerous compression forces on anterior vertebrae.

            These exercises require forward spine flexion and can cause compression fractures in osteoporotic vertebrae.

      answer: "Yes, but only specific exercises. Isometric neck exercises (pushing against resistance without moving) are safest. Gentle chin tucks with wall support and scapular squeezes are also safe. You MUST avoid forward-bending movements, full neck rotations, sit-ups, and high-impact activities. Always get medical clearance first."
    },
    {
      question: "What T-score is too low for neck exercises?",
      answer: "There's no absolute cutoff, but T-scores below -2.5 (severe osteoporosis) require extreme caution and must be supervised by a physical therapist. T-scores between -1 and -2.5 (osteopenia) still need modifications. Work with your doctor to determine safe exercises for your specific bone density."
    },
    {
      question: "Why are forward-bending exercises dangerous with osteoporosis?",
      answer: "Forward bending (flexion) creates compression forces on the front of vertebrae, where osteoporotic bones are weakest. This significantly increases compression fracture risk. Studies show that even 50 pounds of forward-bending force can fracture osteoporotic vertebrae. This is why sit-ups and looking down excessively are prohibited."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I do neck exercises with osteoporosis?",
      answer: "Start with 3-4 days per week for the first month, then progress to 5-6 days per week once you're confident in proper form. Do 1 set of each exercise initially, progressing to 2-3 sets after 4-6 weeks. Consistency matters more than intensity with osteoporosis."
    },
    {
      question: "Will neck exercises help build bone density?",
      answer: "Neck exercises primarily strengthen muscles that support the spine and improve posture, reducing fracture risk. They may have modest effects on bone density but won't reverse osteoporosis. Weight-bearing exercise (walking, dancing), calcium, vitamin D, and medications (if prescribed) are more important for bone density."
