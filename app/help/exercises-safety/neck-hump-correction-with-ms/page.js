      <p className="mb-4">
        Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune neurological condition where the immune system attacks the protective 
        myelin sheath covering nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. This disrupts nerve signal transmission, causing 
        a wide range of symptoms including fatigue, weakness, balance problems, visual disturbances, heat sensitivity, and 
        cognitive changes. MS is unpredictable - symptoms vary daily and can worsen temporarily (relapses) or permanently 
        (progression).
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Exercise is beneficial for MS patients - research shows it can improve strength, balance, fatigue levels, and quality 
        of life without increasing relapse risk. However, MS-specific challenges make standard exercise protocols inappropriate. 
        The primary obstacles are profound fatigue (often the most disabling MS symptom), heat sensitivity (Uhthoff's 
        phenomenon - temporary symptom worsening with heat), balance and coordination difficulties, and unpredictable 
        symptom variability requiring constant adaptation.

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">1. MS Fatigue (Primary Disability)</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            MS fatigue is neurological, not muscle fatigue. It's overwhelming, doesn't improve with rest, and worsens 
            throughout the day. Exercise must use minimal energy to avoid severe fatigue that can last days. This means 
            drastically reduced exercise volume compared to standard recommendations.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Heat temporarily worsens MS symptoms. Even slight body temperature increases from exercise can cause vision 
            blurring, weakness, fatigue, or dizziness. Exercise must be done in cool environments, during cooler times of 
            day, and with strategies to prevent overheating.

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Cerebellar involvement in MS causes balance problems, tremor, and coordination difficulties. Neck exercises 
            must be done seated with back support to prevent falls. Standing exercises are often inappropriate without 
            assistive devices or supervision.

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Optic neuritis and other MS-related visual problems can worsen with exercise (especially heat-inducing exercise). 
            Neck movements might trigger transient vision changes. If vision problems occur during exercise, stop immediately.

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Relapsing-remitting MS has unpredictable exacerbations requiring exercise cessation during relapses. Progressive 
            MS has gradual worsening requiring continuous exercise adaptation. Exercise protocols must account for MS type 
            and current disease activity.

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">1. Supported Isometric Neck Exercises (Best for MS)</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Sit in stable chair with high back for head support. Place palm on forehead. 
            Push head forward into hand at only 30-40% effort while resisting - head shouldn't move. Hold 3-4 seconds (NOT 5-6). 
            Rest 10-15 seconds. Repeat with hand on back of head, then each side. Do 3-4 reps each direction TOTAL, 2-3x per week.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why best for MS:</strong> No movement eliminates balance concerns. Minimal energy expenditure. Short hold 
            times prevent fatigue. Generates minimal heat. Can be done even on moderate fatigue days.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Adaptation for severe MS:</strong> Reduce effort to 20-30% and holds to 2-3 seconds. Do 2-3 reps only. 
            This is still beneficial exercise for severe MS.
          </p>

          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Sit in high-backed chair so your head rests against the backrest. Gently pull 
            chin straight back, pressing back of head into chair. This provides tactile feedback. Hold 3-4 seconds. Do 5-6 
            reps, 2-3x per week.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why adapted for MS:</strong> Chair support provides stability and tactile cues (important with 
            proprioception deficits in MS). Sitting eliminates balance requirements. Minimal energy use.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Skip if:</strong> This causes dizziness or visual disturbances. Some MS patients have increased 
            symptoms with neck retraction movements.
          </p>

          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Sit with back supported. Gently squeeze shoulder blades together at 40-50% 
            effort. Hold 4-5 seconds. Do 6-8 reps, 2-3x per week. This is safer than neck-focused exercises for some 
            MS patients.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why effective for MS:</strong> Strengthens upper back without requiring head/neck movement. Reduces 
            fall risk (no balance component). Addresses thoracic posture which influences neck alignment.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Modification:</strong> If shoulder weakness prevents squeeze, just think about squeezing (mental imagery 
            activation) or use 20-30% effort. Any activation counts.
          </p>

          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Sit with good head/back support. Slowly turn head to one side only 20-30% of 
            full range. Hold 2-3 seconds. Return to center slowly. Alternate sides. Do 4-6 TOTAL rotations (not per side), 
            2x per week maximum.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why minimal range:</strong> Full neck rotation can worsen MS-related dizziness and visual disturbances. 
            Small movements maintain functional mobility without triggering symptoms.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>STOP IMMEDIATELY if:</strong> You experience vision changes, dizziness, vertigo, or worsening of any 
            MS symptoms. Not all MS patients tolerate rotation exercises.

    {
      question: "Why do I need so much less exercise volume with MS?",
      answer: "MS fatigue is neurological, not muscle fatigue. It's caused by demyelination affecting nerve signal efficiency. Exercise that's fine for others can severely deplete your limited energy envelope, causing fatigue crashes lasting days. Ultra-low volume (3-5 minutes, 2-3x/week) provides benefits without exceeding your energy capacity."
    },
    {
      question: "Will exercise make my MS worse or trigger relapses?",
      answer: "No - research shows appropriate exercise does NOT increase relapse risk or worsen MS. However, inappropriate exercise (too intense, causing overheating, exceeding energy envelope) CAN temporarily worsen symptoms. This is why MS-adapted protocols with cooling strategies and low volume are essential."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I exercise during an MS relapse?",
      answer: "NO. Stop all exercises during active relapses. Your nervous system is actively inflamed during relapses. Focus on steroid treatment (if prescribed), rest, and symptom management. Resume exercises only after relapse resolves (typically 2-6 weeks), starting at 50% of your pre-relapse level."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I manage heat sensitivity during exercise?",
      answer: "Exercise in air-conditioned room (68-72°F), during coolest time of day (morning), wear light clothing, use cooling vest if available, drink cold water before/during exercise, and stop immediately if you feel warm. Even slight overheating temporarily worsens all MS symptoms (Uhthoff's phenomenon)."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I can't tolerate any neck exercises due to MS symptoms?",
      answer: "Focus on scapular exercises only, which influence neck posture indirectly without head/neck movement. Or do posture awareness exercises (sitting upright consciously) without active movement. Even minimal activity provides some benefit. Work with MS-specialized PT to find what you CAN do."
