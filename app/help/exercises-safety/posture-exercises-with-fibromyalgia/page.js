      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Understanding Fibromyalgia and Exercise Challenges</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, cognitive difficulties ("fibro fog"), 
        and heightened sensitivity to pain. The condition affects how your nervous system processes pain signals, causing 
        your body to amplify pain sensations. This makes exercise uniquely challenging because activities that benefit most 
        people can trigger severe pain flares in fibromyalgia patients.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        However, appropriate exercise is one of the most effective non-pharmacological treatments for fibromyalgia. Studies 
        show that gentle, gradually progressive exercise can reduce pain levels, improve sleep quality, decrease fatigue, and 
        enhance overall function. The critical challenge is finding the "Goldilocks zone" - enough exercise to provide benefits 
        without triggering post-exertional malaise or pain flares that can last days or weeks.
      </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">1. Central Sensitization</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Your nervous system amplifies pain signals. What feels like mild stretching to others may feel intensely painful 
            to you. This isn't "in your head" - it's real physiological pain amplification requiring gentler approaches.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Overdoing exercise - even slightly - can cause severe fatigue and pain increases lasting 24-72 hours or longer. 
            This creates a frustrating cycle: you feel good, do too much, then crash for days. Pacing is critical.
          </p>

        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">3. Variable Daily Function</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Fibromyalgia symptoms fluctuate dramatically day-to-day or even hour-to-hour. An exercise you could do yesterday 
            might be impossible today. Exercise programs must adapt to daily functional capacity.
          </p>

        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">4. Sleep Disruption</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Fibromyalgia causes non-restorative sleep. You're already exhausted, making exercise timing and intensity 
            critical. Exercising at wrong times or intensities can worsen sleep, creating a vicious cycle.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">The Pacing Principle: Your Most Important Tool</h3>
      
      <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
        <h4 className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-3">What is Pacing?</h4>
        <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-3">
          Pacing means stopping BEFORE your symptoms increase, even if you feel you could do more. It's counterintuitive 
          but essential. If you can do 10 neck rotations without pain increase, do only 5-6. If you can exercise for 10 
          minutes, stop at 5-7 minutes. This builds tolerance slowly without triggering crashes.
        </p>
        
        <h5 className="font-medium text-blue-900 mb-2">The 50% Rule</h5>
        <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm mb-3">
          On a good day, only do 50% of what you think you can do. This leaves energy reserves and prevents next-day crashes. 
          It feels frustrating initially, but over weeks-to-months, this approach allows gradual progress without setbacks.
        </p>
        
        <h5 className="font-medium text-blue-900 mb-2">Activity Diary</h5>
        <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm">
          Track daily exercises and next-day symptoms. If an exercise level consistently causes symptom increases the next 
          day, you've found your upper limit. Drop back to 70-80% of that amount. Over time, your tolerance will increase.

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">1. Micro-Range Chin Tucks (Safest Starting Exercise)</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Sit in supportive chair. Gently pull chin back just 10-20% of full range 
            (barely noticeable movement). Hold 2-3 seconds only. Do 3-5 reps TOTAL, once daily. That's it - no more.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why start here:</strong> Tiny movements with minimal reps prevent triggering central sensitization. 
            This seems absurdly easy, but for fibromyalgia, starting too hard guarantees failure.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Progression:</strong> After 2 weeks with NO symptom increase, add 1-2 more reps. After another 2 weeks, 
            increase range to 30%. Progress takes months, not weeks. This is normal and appropriate.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">2. Gentle Shoulder Awareness Exercise</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Sit comfortably. Simply think about lifting your shoulder blades up and back 
            slightly - use only 20-30% effort. Hold 3 seconds. Release slowly. Do 3-5 reps, once daily.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why it works:</strong> Engages muscles without significant movement or strain. The goal is muscle 
            awareness and gentle activation, not strengthening (yet).
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Important:</strong> If this causes upper back or shoulder pain, reduce effort to 10-15% or skip this 
            exercise. There's no "must do" list with fibromyalgia.
          </p>

        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">3. Seated Posture Holds</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Sit upright with back supported. Focus on sitting "tall" without straining. 
            Hold good posture for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Rest. Repeat 2-3 times throughout the day when you remember.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why it works:</strong> Builds postural endurance without movement. Uses minimal energy. Can be done 
            during good moments throughout the day.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Modification:</strong> On bad days, just sitting upright for 10-15 seconds counts as exercise. Meet 
            yourself where you are that day.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">4. Gentle Neck Rotation (Limited Range)</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Sit supported. Slowly turn head to one side, moving only 20-30% of full range. 
            Hold 2-3 seconds. Return to center slowly. Alternate sides. Do 3-4 TOTAL rotations (not per side), once daily.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why limited range:</strong> Full neck rotation can trigger neck and shoulder pain in fibromyalgia. 
            Small movements maintain mobility without triggering pain amplification.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Red flag:</strong> If this causes dizziness, skip it entirely. Dizziness is common in fibromyalgia 
            and neck rotation can worsen it.
          </p>

        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">5. Wall Supported Standing (Optional)</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Stand with back against wall for support. Try to align head, upper back, and 
            lower back against wall. Hold 10-20 seconds. Do 2-3 times daily if tolerated.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why wall support:</strong> Standing uses energy. Wall support reduces energy cost and provides 
            stability, important for fibromyalgia-related balance issues.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Skip if:</strong> You have severe fatigue, it's a bad pain day, or standing causes significant 
            symptom increase. Sitting exercises are equally valid.

    {
      question: "Why do exercises seem absurdly easy for fibromyalgia?",
      answer: "Because fibromyalgia involves central sensitization - your nervous system amplifies pain signals. What seems like mild exercise to others can trigger severe symptoms for you. Starting 'too easy' and progressing slowly is the ONLY approach that works long-term for most fibromyalgia patients. This isn't lack of effort - it's smart symptom management."
    },
    {
      question: "How long until I see improvements with fibromyalgia exercises?",
      answer: "Realistic timeline: 3-6 months for noticeable improvements in posture and function. Some patients see reduced pain by 6-12 months. Fibromyalgia improvements are gradual and subtle, not dramatic. Small gains matter: reduced flare frequency, slightly better function on good days, improved sleep quality."
    },
    {
      question: "What if exercises always cause pain flares no matter how gentle?",
      answer: "This happens in some fibromyalgia cases. Try: 1) Even smaller micro-movements (5-10% range), 2) Exercise in warm water, 3) Focus solely on posture awareness without active movement, 4) Address medications with doctor - some fibromyalgia medications improve exercise tolerance, 5) Consider that timing, stress levels, or sleep quality might be factors."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I exercise during a fibromyalgia flare?",
      answer: "NO. During flares, stop all exercises. Your body needs all available energy for managing the flare. Use heat, medications, gentle stretching, and rest. Resume exercises only after returning to your baseline symptoms (typically 3-7 days). When resuming, do only 50% of pre-flare amount for the first week."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it normal to take months to progress with fibromyalgia exercises?",
      answer: "Absolutely yes. Months-long progression timelines are completely normal and appropriate for fibromyalgia. Patients who rush progression almost always experience setbacks. Those who progress slowly over 6-12+ months achieve better long-term results. Be patient with your body's pace."
