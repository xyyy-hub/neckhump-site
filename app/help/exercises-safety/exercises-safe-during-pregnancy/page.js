      question: "Are neck exercises safe during all trimesters of pregnancy?",
      answer: "Most gentle neck exercises are safe throughout pregnancy, but modifications are needed as pregnancy progresses. First trimester: Most exercises are safe.

      question: "Can I do chin tucks while pregnant?",
      answer: "Yes, chin tucks are generally safe during pregnancy when done gently and in a supported position. Use a chair with back support and avoid lying flat on your back after the first trimester. Start with smaller movements and increase gradually as tolerated."
    },
    {
      question: "What exercises should I avoid during pregnancy?",
      answer: "Avoid lying flat on your back after the first trimester, exercises that require lying on your stomach, high-impact movements, exercises that cause dizziness or shortness of breath, and any movements that cause pain or discomfort. Always consult your healthcare provider for specific restrictions."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I do neck exercises during pregnancy?",
      answer: "Start with 5-10 minutes daily and gradually increase as tolerated. Listen to your body and adjust based on how you feel. Some days you may need to skip exercises due to fatigue or other pregnancy symptoms. Consistency is more important than intensity."
    },
    {
      question: "Can posture exercises help with pregnancy-related neck pain?",
      answer: "Yes, gentle posture exercises can help reduce pregnancy-related neck and back pain. As your belly grows, your center of gravity shifts, often causing forward head posture. Gentle chin tucks and posture awareness exercises can help counteract these changes."
