              Most neck exercises can be modified for medical conditions. The key is starting slowly, using proper form, 
              and stopping if you experience pain, dizziness, or numbness. Always consult your healthcare provider first.

              Stop immediately if you experience sharp pain, shooting pain, or pain that worsens. Some muscle soreness 
              is normal, but joint pain, nerve pain, or severe discomfort requires medical evaluation.
