      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Understanding Cervical Fusion Surgery and Recovery</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Cervical fusion surgery (ACDF - Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion, or posterior fusion) permanently 
        joins two or more vertebrae in your neck to eliminate motion at that segment. The surgery addresses conditions 
        like herniated discs, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, or instability. A bone graft (from your body, 
        a donor, or synthetic material) is placed between vertebrae, often with metal plates and screws, to facilitate fusion.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The fusion process takes 3-6 months for initial bone healing and up to 12-18 months for complete remodeling. 
        During this time, your exercise program must carefully balance the need for muscle strengthening (which supports 
        your neck) with the absolute requirement to protect the fusion site while it heals. Starting exercises too early 
        or too aggressively can cause fusion failure (pseudarthrosis), requiring revision surgery.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Why Post-Fusion Exercise Requires Special Protocols</h3>
      
      <div className="space-y-4 mb-6">
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">1. Risk of Hardware Failure</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Plates, screws, and cages holding your fusion together are under significant stress during healing. Excessive 
            neck movement or strain can cause hardware loosening, migration, or breakage before the bone has fully fused.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">2. Pseudarthrosis (Non-Union)</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            If the bone graft doesn't fuse properly (occurs in 5-10% of single-level fusions, higher for multi-level), 
            the vertebrae remain mobile. This causes persistent pain and often requires revision surgery. Premature exercise 
            increases non-union risk.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">3. Adjacent Segment Disease</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Fusing vertebrae increases stress on levels above and below the fusion. Poor exercise progression can 
            accelerate degeneration at adjacent segments, potentially requiring additional surgery in the future.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">4. Muscle Atrophy and Scar Tissue</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Surgical approach causes muscle disruption and scar tissue formation. Exercises must gradually restore 
            muscle function without stressing the fusion, while managing scar tissue development.

      question: "When can I start neck exercises after cervical fusion?",
      answer: "Most surgeons allow gentle isometric exercises (no movement) starting at 6 weeks post-op IF imaging shows good healing. Active range of motion exercises typically begin at 3 months. Full exercise progression usually occurs after 6-month imaging confirms solid fusion. Your surgeon's protocol may differ."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do chin tucks after ACDF surgery?",
      answer: "Not until at least 6 weeks post-op, and only if your surgeon approves. When cleared, start with VERY gentle chin tucks (30-50% range) against wall support. Full-range chin tucks typically wait until 3-6 months post-op with fusion confirmation."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take for cervical fusion to fully heal?",
      answer: "Initial bone healing takes 3-6 months. Complete bone remodeling takes 12-18 months. However, most functional recovery and exercise progression occurs in the first 6-12 months. CT scans at 6-12 months confirm solid fusion in most patients."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I exercise too soon after fusion surgery?",
      answer: "Premature or excessive exercise can cause fusion failure (pseudarthrosis), hardware loosening or breakage, increased pain, and potentially require revision surgery. Revision surgeries are more complex and have lower success rates. Always follow your surgeon's timeline."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I be able to do all neck exercises eventually after fusion?",
      answer: "Most patients return to normal neck exercises by 12 months. However, the fused segment has no motion, so your total neck range will be reduced (typically 10-20% less for single-level fusion). Contact sports and high-risk activities may be permanently restricted."
