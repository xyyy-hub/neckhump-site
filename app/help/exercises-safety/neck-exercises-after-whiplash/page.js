  const shortAnswer = "Neck exercises after whiplash should follow a progressive protocol starting with gentle range-of-motion exercises 24-48 hours after injury.

Most people can start gentle exercises within the first week, but always follow your healthcare provider's specific recommendations."

    {
      title: "Pain Should Guide Progression",
      content: "Exercises should cause minimal to no pain. If an exercise increases your pain significantly or causes pain that lasts more than 2 hours after exercise, you've overdone it and need to reduce intensity."

      title: "Whiplash Severity Varies",

      question: "When can I start neck exercises after whiplash?",
      answer: "Most healthcare providers recommend starting gentle range-of-motion exercises 24-48 hours after whiplash injury, but this depends on severity. Grade 1 (mild) whiplash may allow exercises within days, while severe cases may require weeks. Always follow your healthcare provider's specific recommendations."
    },
    {
      question: "What exercises should I avoid after whiplash?",
      answer: "Avoid rapid head movements, aggressive stretching, heavy resistance exercises, and any movements that cause sharp pain or increase your symptoms. Also avoid exercises that require you to hold your head in extreme positions or that cause dizziness."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does whiplash recovery take?",
      answer: "Recovery time varies significantly. Most people with mild whiplash recover within 2-4 weeks, while severe cases may take 3-6 months or longer. Factors affecting recovery include injury severity, age, previous neck problems, and adherence to treatment recommendations."
    },
    {
      question: "Can exercises make whiplash worse?",
      answer: "Improper or aggressive exercises can worsen whiplash symptoms and delay healing. However, appropriate, gentle exercises can actually speed recovery by maintaining range of motion, reducing stiffness, and preventing muscle atrophy. The key is starting slowly and progressing gradually."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I still have pain after 6 weeks?",
      answer: "If you still have significant pain after 6 weeks, you may have chronic whiplash and should consult with a healthcare provider. You may need additional treatment such as physical therapy, massage therapy, or other interventions. Don't try to push through persistent pain."
