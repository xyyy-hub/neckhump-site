      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Remote Workers Are Prone to Posture Problems</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Remote work presents unique challenges for maintaining good posture. Unlike traditional office environments, home offices often 
        lack proper ergonomic setups, and the boundaries between work and personal life can blur, leading to longer periods of sitting 
        and less structured breaks. The combination of poor home office ergonomics, increased screen time, and reduced physical activity 
        creates the perfect environment for developing neck hump and forward head posture.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The good news is that remote workers have more control over their environment and schedule, making it easier to implement 
        posture-friendly habits and exercises. With the right strategies, you can create a home office that supports good posture 
        and incorporate exercises that fit seamlessly into your workday.

        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">1. Poor Home Office Setup</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Working from couches, beds, or dining tables often means poor ergonomics. Laptops placed too low force you to look down, 
            while inadequate back support leads to slouching and forward head posture.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">2. Increased Screen Time</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Remote work often means more video calls, longer computer sessions, and increased device usage. This extended screen time 
            can lead to eye strain, neck tension, and poor posture habits.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">3. Reduced Physical Activity</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Without the commute, office walking, and structured breaks, remote workers often move less throughout the day. This 
            sedentary lifestyle contributes to muscle stiffness and postural problems.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">4. Blurred Work-Life Boundaries</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Working longer hours without clear boundaries can lead to extended periods of poor posture. The lack of structured 
            breaks and the temptation to work from comfortable but unsupportive furniture can worsen posture problems.
