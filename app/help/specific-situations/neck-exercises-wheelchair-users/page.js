      <p className="mb-4">
        Wheelchair users face unique challenges when it comes to neck posture and exercise. The seated position, limited mobility, 
        and potential for muscle imbalances can contribute to neck hump and forward head posture. However, with proper adaptations, 
        many effective neck exercises can be performed safely and effectively from a wheelchair.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The key is finding exercises that work within the constraints of wheelchair use while still providing the benefits of 
        improved posture, increased strength, and reduced pain. Many traditional neck exercises can be adapted for seated positions, 
        and some exercises are actually more effective when performed seated with proper back support.
