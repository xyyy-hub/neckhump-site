        Healthcare professionals—especially nurses—face unique postural challenges that accelerate forward head 
        posture and neck hump development:

        <ul className="space-y-3">
          <li>
            <strong>Computer Charting:</strong> Looking down at workstations on wheels (WOWs) or nursing stations 
            for hours, often with poor monitor height and lighting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Patient Care Tasks:</strong> Leaning forward during examinations, wound care, IV placement, 
            vitals checks—all requiring sustained neck flexion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Long Shifts:</strong> 12-hour shifts without adequate breaks, leading to fatigue-induced slouching 
            as the day progresses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Awkward Positions:</strong> Bending over hospital beds that are too low, reaching across patients, 
            twisting while transferring patients.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Phone/Mobile Device Use:</strong> Constant checking of secure messaging, orders, and 
            documentation on smartphones and tablets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Standing All Day:</strong> Prolonged standing leads to overall fatigue that worsens posture, 
            especially in final hours of shift.

        <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Workstation on Wheels (WOW) Setup</h4>
        <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>• <strong>Height:</strong> Adjust monitor to eye level—most WOWs are too low by default</li>
          <li>• <strong>Keyboard tray:</strong> Use adjustable tray if available, keep elbows at 90 degrees</li>
          <li>• <strong>Standing posture:</strong> Don't lean over WOW—pull it closer to you instead</li>
          <li>• <strong>Lighting:</strong> Adjust screen brightness to reduce squinting and forward lean</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-6">Patient Care Ergonomics</h4>
        <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>• <strong>Bed height:</strong> Raise bed to hip/waist level for procedures—don't lean over</li>
          <li>• <strong>Positioning:</strong> Move around bed rather than reaching across patient</li>
          <li>• <strong>Bending:</strong> Bend from hips, not neck, when examining wounds or doing IV placement</li>
          <li>• <strong>Support arm:</strong> Use non-dominant arm to support body when leaning forward</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-6">Mobile Device Use</h4>
        <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>• <strong>Height:</strong> Bring device to eye level rather than looking down</li>
          <li>• <strong>Two hands:</strong> Hold device with both hands at chest height when reading</li>
          <li>• <strong>Breaks:</strong> After checking device, immediately do 3-5 chin tucks to counteract</li>
          <li>• <strong>Voice dictation:</strong> Use voice-to-text when possible to reduce screen time</li>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">At-Home Recovery Routine (Post-Shift)</h3>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        After long shifts, dedicate 10-15 minutes to recovery exercises that undo the damage of prolonged 
        forward posture:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Upper back foam rolling:</strong> 3-5 minutes to release tight upper back muscles</li>
        <li><strong>Wall angels:</strong> 3 sets of 10 reps to strengthen retractor muscles</li>
        <li><strong>Chin tucks with hold:</strong> 3 sets of 10 reps with 10-second holds</li>
        <li><strong>Doorway pec stretch:</strong> 60-second holds on each side</li>
        <li><strong>Neck circles:</strong> 10 each direction to restore mobility</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Do this routine immediately after work before showering. Consistency with this recovery routine is more 
        important than intensity.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Fatigue Management Strategies</h3>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Fatigue from long shifts causes postural breakdown even if you start with good intentions. Address 
        fatigue to maintain better posture:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Compression socks:</strong> Reduce leg fatigue that affects whole-body posture</li>
        <li><strong>Supportive footwear:</strong> Quality shoes reduce overall fatigue significantly</li>
        <li><strong>Hydration and nutrition:</strong> Maintain energy levels throughout shift</li>
        <li><strong>Micro-breaks:</strong> Even 30 seconds of posture resets every hour helps</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep priority:</strong> 7-8 hours minimum between shifts for muscle recovery</li>
      </ul>

        <h4 className="font-semibold text-yellow-900 mb-2">Reality Check: You Won't Be Perfect</h4>
        <p className="text-yellow-900">
          Healthcare work is demanding. You won't maintain perfect posture for 12 hours. That's okay. The goal is 
          to do frequent micro-corrections (chin tucks every 2 hours) and a solid recovery routine post-shift. 
          This approach is realistic and sustainable long-term.

    {
      question: "What's the best posture exercise for healthcare workers?",
      answer: "Chin tucks are most practical for healthcare settings because they take only 1 minute, can be done standing or sitting, don't require equipment, and directly counteract forward head posture from charting and patient care. Do 10 reps every 2 hours during shifts."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I set up nursing station computers ergonomically?",
      answer: "Adjust WOW (workstation on wheels) monitor to eye level—most are too low by default. Keep keyboard at height where elbows are at 90 degrees. Pull WOW close to you rather than leaning over it. Increase screen brightness if you find yourself squinting or leaning forward."
    },
    {
      question: "Why do my neck and shoulders hurt after long nursing shifts?",
      answer: "Pain comes from looking down at charts/computers, leaning over low hospital beds, and sustained forward posture during patient care. Combined with 12-hour shifts and fatigue, muscles fatigue and posture breaks down. Do hourly micro-corrections (chin tucks, shoulder rolls) and a 10-15 minute recovery routine after every shift."
    },
    {
      question: "What can I do after work to recover from bad posture during shifts?",
      answer: "Do a 10-15 minute post-shift routine immediately after work: upper back foam rolling (3-5 min), wall angels (3 sets of 10), chin tucks with 10-second holds (3 sets of 10), doorway pec stretches (60 seconds each side), and neck circles. Consistency with this recovery routine prevents cumulative damage from shifts."
