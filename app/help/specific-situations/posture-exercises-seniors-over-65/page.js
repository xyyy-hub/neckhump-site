      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Posture Exercises Are Important for Seniors</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        As we age, maintaining good posture becomes increasingly important for overall health and quality of life. Seniors over 65 
        often develop forward head posture and neck hump due to years of poor posture habits, muscle weakness, and age-related 
        changes in the spine. However, with the right approach, posture exercises can be both safe and effective for seniors.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Research shows that gentle, consistent posture exercises can help seniors maintain independence, reduce fall risk, 
        improve breathing, and decrease pain. The key is using age-appropriate modifications that account for common 
        conditions like osteoporosis, arthritis, and reduced flexibility.
