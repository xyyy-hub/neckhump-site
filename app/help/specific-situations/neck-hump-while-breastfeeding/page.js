      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Breastfeeding Can Cause Neck Hump</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Breastfeeding mothers are particularly susceptible to developing neck hump due to the repetitive forward-leaning posture 
        required during feeding sessions. The combination of looking down at your baby, holding your baby for extended periods, 
        and the physical demands of new motherhood can quickly lead to forward head posture and upper back rounding.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        New mothers often spend 6-8 hours daily in feeding positions, which can cause significant postural changes over time. 
        The good news is that with proper positioning, ergonomic support, and gentle exercises, you can prevent and even 
        reverse neck hump while continuing to breastfeed successfully.

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">1. Looking Down at Baby</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Constantly looking down at your baby during feeding causes your head to move forward, creating forward head posture. 
            This is the most common cause of neck hump in breastfeeding mothers.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">2. Leaning Forward to Reach Baby</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Leaning forward to bring your breast to your baby's mouth instead of bringing your baby to your breast puts 
            excessive strain on your upper back and neck muscles.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">3. Poor Support and Positioning</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Not using enough pillows or using the wrong type of support forces you to hold awkward positions that strain 
            your neck and upper back muscles.

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">4. Extended Feeding Sessions</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Long feeding sessions without breaks or position changes can cause muscle fatigue and postural compensation, 
            leading to neck hump development.
