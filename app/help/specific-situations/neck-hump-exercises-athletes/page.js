      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How Forward Head Posture Affects Athletic Performance</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Forward head posture doesn't just affect appearance - it directly impacts athletic performance. When your head 
        is positioned forward of your center of gravity, it creates several performance-limiting issues: reduced breathing 
        capacity (up to 30% decrease in lung function), impaired shoulder mobility, decreased force production, slower 
        reaction times, and increased injury risk, particularly in the neck, shoulders, and upper back.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Many athletes develop forward head posture from sport-specific movements and training patterns. Cyclists hunch 
        over handlebars, weightlifters develop tight pecs and front delts, swimmers rotate constantly, and desk-bound 
        athletes compound training stress with poor work posture. Correcting these patterns not only improves appearance 
        but also enhances performance and reduces injury risk.
      </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">1. Cyclists and Forward Posture</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Hours hunched over handlebars create extreme forward head posture. The racing position forces your neck 
            into extension while your upper back rounds forward, creating significant muscle imbalances.
          </p>
        </div>

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Overemphasis on bench press and front delt work creates tight chest muscles and weak upper back muscles. 
            This pulls shoulders forward and encourages forward head posture, especially combined with sedentary work.

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Constant neck rotation to breathe during freestyle swimming can create asymmetrical neck development and 
            forward head posture. The rounded shoulder position in water doesn't help either.

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            While running mechanics are often good, many runners develop neck hump from looking down at phones and 
            watches during training, plus poor recovery posture between workouts.

          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Lie on your back with head off bench. Perform chin tucks while holding a 
            light weight plate (2.5-5 lbs) on forehead. Do 3 sets of 12-15 reps. Progress weight slowly.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">

    },
    {
      question: "How do I fit posture exercises into my training schedule?",
      answer: "Add chin tucks and band pull-aparts to warm-ups, do band work between sets as filler, and spend 10 minutes post-training on mobility work. This adds minimal time but provides significant benefits. You can also do 100 daily band pull-aparts spread throughout the day."

    {
      question: "Do I need to reduce training volume to fix my posture?",
      answer: "No, but you need to rebalance it. Ensure 2-3 times more pulling than pushing volume. Most athletes can add posture work without reducing sport-specific training - it actually enhances recovery and performance."
    },
    {
      question: "Why do cyclists have such bad forward head posture?",
      answer: "The racing position requires extreme forward head posture for hours. The neck extends to see forward while the upper back rounds over handlebars. This creates severe muscle imbalances. Cyclists need daily thoracic extensions and strong neck extensors to counter this."
    },
    {
      question: "How long until I see performance improvements from better posture?",
      answer: "You'll likely notice better breathing and less neck fatigue within 2-3 weeks. Measurable performance improvements (increased power, better mobility) typically appear after 4-6 weeks of consistent work. Visual posture changes take 2-3 months."
