      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Office Workers Are Prone to Neck Hump</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Office workers spend 6-8 hours daily in seated positions, often with poor ergonomics and limited movement opportunities. 
        This creates the perfect environment for developing neck hump and forward head posture. The combination of looking down at 
        computer screens, slouching in chairs, and minimal physical activity throughout the day leads to muscle imbalances and 
        postural problems.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The good news is that with the right strategies, office workers can prevent and even reverse neck hump while maintaining 
        productivity. The key is incorporating desk-friendly exercises into your workday and optimizing your workstation setup 
        to support good posture.

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">1. Forward Head Posture</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Looking down at computer screens, phones, or documents causes your head to move forward, creating the classic 
            forward head posture that leads to neck hump over time.
          </p>

        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">2. Rounded Shoulders</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Typing and using a mouse with poor arm support causes your shoulders to round forward, which pulls your head 
            forward and creates muscle imbalances in your upper back and neck.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">3. Slouched Lower Back</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Poor chair support and extended sitting cause your lower back to collapse, which affects your entire spine 
            alignment and contributes to neck and upper back problems.
          </p>

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Staying in the same position for hours causes muscles to stiffen and become tense, leading to discomfort 
            and making it harder to maintain good posture.
