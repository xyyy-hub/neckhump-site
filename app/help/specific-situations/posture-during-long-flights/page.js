      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Long Flights Are Hard on Your Posture</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Long flights present unique challenges for maintaining good posture. The cramped seating, limited legroom, and inability 
        to move freely can quickly lead to poor posture habits that contribute to neck hump and forward head posture. Understanding 
        these challenges is the first step toward finding solutions that work within the constraints of air travel.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The combination of extended sitting, poor seat ergonomics, and the tendency to lean forward to read or use devices creates 
        a perfect storm for postural problems. However, with the right strategies and travel-friendly exercises, you can maintain 
        good posture and arrive at your destination feeling better than when you left.

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">1. Forward Head Posture</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Leaning forward to read, use devices, or see the screen in front of you causes your head to move forward, 
            creating the classic forward head posture that leads to neck hump.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">2. Rounded Shoulders</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Cramped armrests and limited space cause your shoulders to round forward, which pulls your head forward 
            and creates muscle imbalances in your upper back and neck.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">3. Slouched Lower Back</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Poor seat support and extended sitting cause your lower back to collapse, which affects your entire 
            spine alignment and contributes to neck and upper back problems.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">4. Muscle Stiffness</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Staying in the same position for hours causes muscles to stiffen and become tense, leading to 
            discomfort and making it harder to maintain good posture.
