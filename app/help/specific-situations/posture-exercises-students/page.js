      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Students Are at High Risk for Neck Hump</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Students spend extensive hours hunched over textbooks, laptops, and smartphones, often in suboptimal postures. 
        Whether studying in dorm rooms, libraries, or coffee shops, students frequently sacrifice ergonomics for convenience. 
        The combination of long study sessions, poor lighting causing forward head posture, and the constant use of mobile 
        devices creates the perfect storm for developing neck hump and forward head posture.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The good news is that with simple adjustments and regular exercise breaks, students can maintain good posture while 
        excelling in their studies. The key is building healthy study habits early and making posture correction part of 
        your daily routine.
      </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">1. Laptop Neck</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Looking down at laptop screens for hours causes severe forward head posture. Laptop screens are typically 
            too low, forcing students to crane their necks downward throughout study sessions.
          </p>
        </div>

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">2. Bed and Couch Studying</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Studying in bed or on couches feels comfortable but creates terrible posture habits. These positions 
            encourage slouching, rounded shoulders, and forward head position.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">3. Phone Overuse</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Students check phones constantly, typically holding them at chest level, which creates significant strain 
            on the neck. This "text neck" phenomenon contributes directly to forward head posture.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">4. Heavy Backpack Posture</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Carrying heavy backpacks on one shoulder or with poor weight distribution affects posture throughout 
            the day and contributes to muscle imbalances that lead to neck hump.

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">1. Chin Tucks Between Study Sessions</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Take a study break and do 10-15 chin tucks. Sit up straight, gently pull 
            your chin back creating a "double chin", hold for 5 seconds, release. This realigns your cervical spine.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Benefits:</strong> Strengthens deep neck flexors, reverses forward head posture, improves neck alignment.
          </p>

        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">2. Shoulder Rolls and Squeezes</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Roll your shoulders backward 10 times, then squeeze your shoulder blades 
            together 10 times. This counters the rounded shoulder position from studying.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Benefits:</strong> Opens up chest, strengthens upper back muscles, reduces rounded shoulders.
          </p>

        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">

          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Stand in a doorway with arms at 90 degrees on the door frame. Step forward 
            until you feel a stretch across your chest. Hold for 30 seconds, repeat 3 times.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Benefits:</strong> Opens tight chest muscles, improves shoulder position, counters hunched posture.
          </p>

        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">

          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Gently tilt your head to each side, holding for 15 seconds. Then slowly 
            turn your head left and right. Do this discreetly between study sessions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Benefits:</strong> Reduces muscle tension, improves range of motion, prevents stiffness.

          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>How to do it:</strong> Every hour, stand up and walk around for 5 minutes. Walk to get water, 
            use the bathroom, or simply pace while reviewing flashcards.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Benefits:</strong> Improves circulation, prevents stiffness, allows your body to reset posture.

      question: "What's the cheapest way to improve study ergonomics?",

    {
      question: "How can I remember to take posture breaks while studying?",
