      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Pregnant Women Are Prone to Posture Problems</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Pregnancy brings significant changes to a woman's body that can affect posture and contribute to neck hump development. 
        As the baby grows, the center of gravity shifts forward, causing the lower back to arch more and the upper back to round 
        forward to compensate. This postural change, combined with hormonal changes that affect ligaments and joints, can lead 
        to muscle imbalances and neck hump.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Additionally, pregnancy often involves increased stress, fatigue, and changes in daily activities that can contribute to 
        poor posture habits. The good news is that with proper modifications and guidance, pregnant women can safely maintain 
        good posture and even improve existing neck hump through appropriate exercises.

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">1. Shifting Center of Gravity</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            As the baby grows, your center of gravity moves forward, causing your lower back to arch more and your upper back 
            to round forward to compensate. This can lead to forward head posture and neck hump.
          </p>

        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">2. Hormonal Changes</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Pregnancy hormones like relaxin can affect ligaments and joints, making them more flexible but also more prone to 
            strain. This can contribute to muscle imbalances and postural problems.
          </p>
        </div>

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">3. Increased Breast Size</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            As breasts grow during pregnancy, they can pull the shoulders forward and contribute to rounded shoulders and 
            forward head posture, worsening neck hump.
          </p>

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Pregnancy fatigue and stress can lead to poor posture habits, such as slouching or leaning forward, which can 
            contribute to neck hump development.
