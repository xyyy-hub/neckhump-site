          <li>• You can complete 15-20 reps easily without muscle fatigue</li>
          <li>• You've been doing the current exercises for at least 4-6 weeks consistently</li>
          <li>• Your form is perfect on every single repetition</li>
          <li>• You feel no muscle activation or "burn" during the exercise</li>
          <li>• You could easily do many more reps if you wanted to</li>
          <li>• Your posture has noticeably improved (measured by photos or assessment)</li>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Safe Progression Strategies</h3>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Follow this progression hierarchy—each step should take 2-4 weeks before moving to the next:
      </p>

      <div className="space-y-4 mb-6">
        <div className="bg-white border-2 border-blue-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Level 1: Increase Repetitions</h4>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm text-gray-700">
            <strong>Current:</strong> 10 reps → <strong>Progress to:</strong> 15-20 reps
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700">
            Start by simply doing more repetitions. This builds endurance and ensures you've truly mastered the 
            movement pattern. Increase by 2-3 reps per week until you reach 20.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-white border-2 border-blue-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Level 2: Add Isometric Holds</h4>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm text-gray-700">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Chin tucks with 10-15 second holds in retracted position
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700">
            After completing each repetition, hold the contracted position for 10-15 seconds before releasing. 
            This significantly increases muscle engagement without changing the exercise.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-white border-2 border-blue-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Level 3: Increase Sets</h4>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm text-gray-700">
            <strong>Current:</strong> 1 set of 20 reps → <strong>Progress to:</strong> 2-3 sets of 15 reps
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700">
            Perform multiple sets with 30-60 second rest between. This increases total training volume and 
            builds greater strength.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-white border-2 border-blue-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Level 4: Add Manual Resistance</h4>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm text-gray-700">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Place hand on forehead during chin tucks and push gently against your own resistance
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700">
            Use your hand to provide gentle resistance against the movement. This adds load without equipment. 
            Start with minimal resistance and gradually increase pressure.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-white border-2 border-blue-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Level 5: Add Resistance Bands</h4>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm text-gray-700">
            <strong>Equipment needed:</strong> Light resistance band ($5-15)
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-700">
            Attach a light resistance band to provide external resistance. Start with the lightest band and focus 
            on maintaining perfect form. This is the most advanced home progression.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-white border-2 border-blue-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Level 6: Advanced Exercise Variations</h4>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm text-gray-700">
            <strong>Example progressions:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul className="text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-1">

      <div className="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
        <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">⚠️ Warning Signs of Over-Progression</h4>
        <ul className="space-y-2 text-red-800">
          <li>• New pain or increased existing pain during or after exercises</li>
          <li>• Form breaks down—you can't maintain proper technique</li>
          <li>• Excessive muscle soreness lasting more than 48 hours</li>
          <li>• Feeling of strain or tension in neck during daily activities</li>
          <li>• Headaches or dizziness that weren't present before</li>
          <li>• Decreased motivation to exercise due to difficulty/discomfort</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4 text-red-900">
          <strong>Solution:</strong> If you experience any of these, regress one level and maintain that for 2-3 weeks 
          before trying to progress again.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">How Long to Stay at Each Level?</h3>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        A good general rule:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Minimum:</strong> 2 weeks at each progression level</li>
        <li><strong>Ideal:</strong> 4 weeks at each level for optimal adaptation</li>
        <li><strong>If recovering from injury:</strong> 6-8 weeks at each level</li>
        <li><strong>If over 50 years old:</strong> 4-6 weeks at each level for slower tissue adaptation</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Remember: <strong>There's no rush.</strong> Slow, consistent progression is safer and more effective than 
        rapid advancement. Many people stay at intermediate levels indefinitely and still see excellent results.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Do I Need to Keep Progressing Forever?</h3>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>No.</strong> Once you've corrected your neck hump and forward head posture (typically 3-6 months), 
        you can maintain your progress with moderate-level exercises. You don't need to keep adding difficulty forever.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        For <strong>maintenance</strong>, most people do:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>2-3 sets of 15 reps of their favorite exercises</li>
        <li>3-4 days per week (down from daily during correction phase)</li>
        <li>Focus on form and consistency rather than progression</li>

    {
      question: "How do I know when exercises are too easy?",
      answer: "Exercises are too easy when you can complete 15-20 repetitions with perfect form without any muscle fatigue or 'burn' sensation, and you've been doing them consistently for at least 4-6 weeks. You should also have no pain and noticeably improved posture."
    },
    {
      question: "How long should I wait before progressing neck exercises?",
      answer: "Wait at least 4 weeks before progressing, even if exercises feel easy sooner. Spend 2-4 weeks at each new progression level. Older adults (50+) or those recovering from injury should wait 4-6 weeks per level for proper tissue adaptation."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the safest way to make neck exercises harder?",
      answer: "Follow this progression: 1) Increase repetitions (10→20), 2) Add isometric holds (10-15 seconds), 3) Increase sets (1→3 sets), 4) Add manual resistance (your hand), 5) Add resistance bands, 6) Try advanced variations. Spend 2-4 weeks at each level."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I skip progression levels and go straight to advanced exercises?",
      answer: "No, skipping progression levels increases injury risk. Each level builds strength and neuromuscular control needed for the next. Rushing progression often leads to poor form, pain, or injury. Slow, methodical progression is safer and more effective long-term."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to keep making exercises harder forever?",
      answer: "No, once you've corrected your posture (typically 3-6 months), you can maintain with moderate-level exercises. Most people settle at 2-3 sets of 15 reps, 3-4 days per week for maintenance. Continuous progression isn't necessary for maintaining good posture."
