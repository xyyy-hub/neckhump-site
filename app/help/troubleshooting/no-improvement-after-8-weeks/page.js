      <p className="mb-4">
        Not seeing improvement after 8 weeks of neck hump exercises can be frustrating, but it's more common than you might think. 
        Many people expect quick results, but neck hump correction is a gradual process that requires consistency, proper technique, 
        and addressing multiple contributing factors.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Research shows that visible posture changes typically take 8-16 weeks with consistent exercise, and some people may need 
        even longer depending on the severity of their condition, age, and other factors. The key is identifying what might be 
        preventing your progress and making appropriate adjustments.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Common Reasons for No Improvement</h3>
      
      <div className="space-y-4 mb-6">
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">1. Incorrect Exercise Form</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            The most common issue is poor technique. If you're not performing exercises correctly, you're not targeting the right muscles 
            or creating the necessary changes. Many people think they're doing chin tucks correctly but are actually just nodding their head.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">2. Insufficient Frequency or Intensity</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Doing exercises once daily for 5 minutes isn't enough for significant changes. You need 2-3 sessions daily with proper 
            intensity to create meaningful muscle strengthening and postural changes.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">3. Not Addressing Root Causes</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            If you're still spending 8+ hours daily in poor posture at work, exercises alone won't be enough. You need to address 
            workstation ergonomics, sleep position, and daily habits that contribute to forward head posture.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">4. Exercises Too Easy</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            If you can do 20+ repetitions without feeling challenged, the exercises aren't providing enough resistance to create 
            muscle strengthening. You need progressive overload to see continued improvement.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">5. Unrealistic Expectations</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Some people expect dramatic changes in 4-6 weeks, but neck hump correction is a gradual process. Visible changes often 
            take 12-16 weeks, and the process continues for months as muscles strengthen and new habits form.

      question: "Is it normal to see no improvement after 8 weeks of neck exercises?",
      answer: "Yes, it's common to see minimal visible improvement after 8 weeks. Most people need 12-16 weeks of consistent exercise to see significant changes. The first 8 weeks are often about building strength and establishing proper form."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the most common reasons for no improvement?",
      answer: "The most common reasons are: 1) Incorrect exercise form, 2) Insufficient frequency (less than 2-3 times daily), 3) Not addressing root causes like poor workstation ergonomics, 4) Exercises too easy without progressive overload, and 5) Unrealistic expectations about timeline."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I do neck exercises to see improvement?",
      answer: "For significant improvement, aim for 2-3 sessions daily, each lasting 5-10 minutes. Consistency is more important than intensity. One long session daily is less effective than multiple shorter sessions throughout the day."
    },
    {
      question: "When should I consider professional help?",
      answer: "Consider seeing a physical therapist if you see no improvement after 12 weeks of consistent, proper exercise. They can assess your form, identify underlying issues, and provide personalized treatment and exercise modifications."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I tell if my exercises are too easy?",
      answer: "If you can do 20+ repetitions without feeling muscle fatigue or challenge, your exercises are too easy. You should feel some muscle fatigue after 8-12 repetitions. Consider adding resistance bands or hand weights to increase difficulty."
