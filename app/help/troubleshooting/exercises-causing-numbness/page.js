STOP IMMEDIATELY if you experience: 1) Numbness/tingling in arms, hands, or fingers, 2) Electric shock sensations, 3) Weakness or clumsiness in hands, 4) Numbness that persists after stopping exercise. This indicates nerve compression (cervical radiculopathy, stenosis, herniated disc, or thoracic outlet syndrome). DO NOT continue exercises. See doctor within 24-48 hours. Temporary hand tingling from gripping/poor arm position is different (mild, resolves immediately, no weakness)."

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Understanding Numbness During Exercise: A Serious Warning Sign</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Numbness and tingling (paresthesias) during neck exercises are NOT normal sensations and should NEVER be ignored. 
        These symptoms indicate nerve compression somewhere along the pathway from your cervical spine to your arms and hands. 
        Unlike muscle fatigue or soreness (which are normal exercise responses), numbness signals that neural tissue is being 
        compressed or irritated - a potentially serious condition requiring immediate medical evaluation.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The cervical spine houses your spinal cord and nerve roots that provide sensation and motor control to your arms and 
        hands. When exercises cause numbness, it means a nerve is being compressed, stretched, or otherwise compromised. 
        Continuing to exercise through numbness can worsen nerve damage, potentially causing permanent neurological deficits. 
        This is one of the few exercise situations where the "stop immediately" rule is absolute.

      <div className="space-y-4 mb-6">
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">1. Cervical Radiculopathy (Pinched Nerve Root)</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>What it is:</strong> Compression or irritation of a nerve root as it exits the cervical spine, usually 
            from herniated disc, bone spurs, or foraminal stenosis. C6 and C7 nerve roots are most commonly affected.
          </p>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Symptoms:</strong> Numbness/tingling following specific dermatomal patterns (C6: thumb and index finger; 
            C7: middle finger and forearm; C8: ring and pinky fingers). Often accompanied by radiating pain down arm, weakness 
            in specific muscle groups.
          </p>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Why exercises trigger it:</strong> Neck extension (looking up), rotation, or certain head positions narrow 
            the neural foramen where nerve roots exit, compressing already-irritated nerves.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">2. Cervical Stenosis (Spinal Canal Narrowing)</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>What it is:</strong> Narrowing of the central spinal canal in the neck, compressing the spinal cord. 
            Often degenerative (age-related) or congenital. More serious than radiculopathy because spinal cord involvement 
            can affect legs and bowel/bladder function.
          </p>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Symptoms:</strong> Bilateral (both arms) numbness/tingling, hand clumsiness, gait problems, possible 
            leg weakness or numbness. Symptoms often worsen with neck extension or certain positions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Why exercises trigger it:</strong> Neck extension reduces spinal canal diameter, further compressing 
            already-narrowed canal and irritating spinal cord.
          </p>
        </div>

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">3. Thoracic Outlet Syndrome (TOS)</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>What it is:</strong> Compression of nerves or blood vessels in the space between your collarbone and 
            first rib (thoracic outlet). Can be neurogenic (nerve compression) or vascular (blood vessel compression).
          </p>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Symptoms:</strong> Numbness/tingling in ring and pinky fingers (C8-T1 distribution), hand weakness, 
            arm pain, sometimes arm discoloration or swelling (if vascular). Symptoms worsen with overhead arm positions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Why exercises trigger it:</strong> Certain head/neck positions or overhead arm movements narrow the 
            thoracic outlet space, compressing neurovascular structures passing through it.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">4. Herniated Cervical Disc</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>What it is:</strong> Rupture of the outer layer of an intervertebral disc, allowing inner nucleus 
            material to bulge out and compress adjacent nerve roots or spinal cord. Often occurs at C5-C6 or C6-C7 levels.
          </p>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Symptoms:</strong> Sudden onset numbness/tingling, severe arm pain following dermatomal distribution, 
            weakness in specific muscles. May have preceded by neck injury or repetitive strain.
          </p>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            <strong>Why exercises trigger it:</strong> Neck movements can further displace disc material, increasing 
            compression on nerve structures. Extension and rotation are particularly problematic.

      question: "Is tingling in hands during neck exercises ever normal?",
      answer: "No - tingling/numbness during neck exercises is NEVER normal and indicates nerve compression. Benign positional tingling (from gripping weights too hard, resolves in 5-10 seconds) is less concerning, but numbness from neck positions or movements is always abnormal and requires medical evaluation."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I finish my workout if numbness occurs?",
      answer: "Absolutely not. Stop immediately the moment numbness occurs. Do not finish your set. Do not try other exercises. Nerve compression can worsen rapidly with continued irritation. Stop all exercise and seek medical evaluation within 24-48 hours."
    },
    {
      question: "What if numbness resolves after I stop exercising?",
      answer: "Still see a doctor within 24-48 hours. Transient numbness that resolves indicates nerve compression that temporarily resolved but underlying problem remains. Do not resume exercises until evaluated. The fact that symptoms occurred at all is significant."
    },
    {
      question: "Could numbness be from something other than nerve compression?",
      answer: "Rarely. Numbness/tingling during neck exercises overwhelmingly indicates cervical nerve compression (radiculopathy, stenosis, herniated disc, thoracic outlet syndrome). Other causes (peripheral neuropathy, B12 deficiency, diabetes) don't typically worsen with specific neck positions. Get evaluated."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I be able to do neck exercises again after numbness?",
      answer: "Depends on cause and treatment response. After medical evaluation, treatment, and clearance, you may return to MODIFIED exercises with PT guidance. Some neck positions may be permanently contraindicated. Many people successfully resume modified exercise programs, but some exercises remain off-limits."
