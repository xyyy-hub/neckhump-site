      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Exercises Might Make Neck Pain Worse</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        It's frustrating when exercises designed to help your neck pain actually make it worse. This is more common than you might think, 
        and it usually indicates that something about your exercise routine needs adjustment. The good news is that with proper troubleshooting, 
        you can identify the cause and modify your approach to get back on track.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Neck pain that worsens with exercise can be caused by several factors, from incorrect technique to underlying medical conditions. 
        Understanding these causes is the first step toward finding a solution that works for your specific situation.

        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">1. Incorrect Exercise Form</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Poor technique is the most common cause of worsening pain. If you're not performing exercises correctly, you may be 
            straining the wrong muscles or putting excessive stress on already compromised areas.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">2. Exercises Too Intense or Too Frequent</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Starting with exercises that are too challenging or doing them too often can cause muscle strain and inflammation, 
            leading to increased pain rather than improvement.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">3. Underlying Medical Conditions</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Conditions like herniated discs, arthritis, or nerve compression can make certain exercises inappropriate and cause 
            pain to worsen rather than improve.
          </p>

        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">4. Muscle Imbalances or Weakness</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            If some muscles are significantly weaker than others, exercises can create additional strain as stronger muscles 
            compensate for weaker ones, leading to increased pain.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">5. Not Addressing Root Causes</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            If you're still spending hours in poor posture at work or using an inappropriate pillow, exercises alone may not 
            be enough to overcome the daily strain on your neck.
