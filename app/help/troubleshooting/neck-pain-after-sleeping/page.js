      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why You Wake Up with Neck Pain</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Waking up with neck pain is a common problem that can significantly impact your day. The pain often occurs because your neck 
        has been in an awkward position for hours, causing muscle strain, joint compression, or nerve irritation. Understanding the 
        common causes and implementing proper sleep hygiene can help you wake up feeling refreshed instead of in pain.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The key to preventing morning neck pain is maintaining proper spinal alignment throughout the night. When your head, neck, 
        and spine are properly aligned, your muscles can relax and recover instead of working to support your head in an unnatural 
        position. This alignment depends on your pillow choice, sleep position, and mattress support.
      </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">1. Poor Pillow Support</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Using a pillow that's too high, too low, or too soft can cause your head to tilt at an awkward angle, 
            straining your neck muscles and joints throughout the night.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">2. Incorrect Sleep Position</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Sleeping on your stomach forces your head to turn to one side for hours, creating significant strain on your neck. 
            This position also flattens your spine's natural curve.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">3. Unsupportive Mattress</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            A mattress that's too soft or too firm can cause your spine to sag or remain too rigid, affecting the alignment 
            of your entire body including your neck.

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Stress and tension can cause you to clench your jaw or tense your neck muscles during sleep, leading to morning 
            stiffness and pain.
          </p>

          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            If you already have neck problems like arthritis, herniated discs, or muscle imbalances, poor sleep posture 
            can exacerbate these conditions and cause morning pain.

      question: "Why do I wake up with neck pain every morning?",
      answer: "Morning neck pain is usually caused by poor pillow support, incorrect sleep position, or an unsupportive mattress. The most common cause is using a pillow that's too high or too low, which forces your head into an awkward position for hours. Sleeping on your stomach is also a major cause of neck pain."

    {
      question: "What's the best sleep position for neck pain?",
      answer: "Sleeping on your back is the best position for neck health as it maintains natural spine alignment. Side sleeping is also good if you use a pillow that fills the gap between your head and shoulder. Avoid sleeping on your stomach as it forces your head to turn to one side for hours."
    },
    {
      question: "What type of pillow should I use for neck pain?",
      answer: "For back sleepers, use a thin to medium pillow that supports your head without pushing it forward. For side sleepers, use a medium to firm pillow that fills the gap between your head and shoulder. For stomach sleepers, use a very thin pillow or no pillow at all."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I relieve neck pain in the morning?",
      answer: "Do gentle morning stretches including neck rolls, side neck stretches, chin tucks, and shoulder rolls. Apply heat or ice to the affected area, and consider taking a warm shower to help relax tense muscles. If pain persists, see a doctor."

    {
      question: "When should I see a doctor for morning neck pain?",
      answer: "See a doctor if neck pain is severe or persistent (lasting more than a few days), radiates down your arms, is accompanied by numbness or tingling, or if you have difficulty moving your neck. Also seek medical attention if pain worsens over time or is accompanied by other symptoms like headaches or dizziness."
