  const shortAnswer = "Not feeling neck muscles during exercises usually means poor form, moving too fast, or underdeveloped mind-muscle connection. Slow down each repetition to 4-5 seconds, focus intensely on the target muscles, use isometric holds for 10 seconds, and try manual resistance with your hand. Visualize the muscles contracting and place fingers on the muscles to feel activation. Most people develop better activation within 2-3 weeks of focused practice."

      <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
        <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Common Causes of Poor Muscle Activation</h4>
        <ul className="space-y-3">
          <li>
            <strong>1. Moving Too Fast:</strong> Rapid, jerky movements use momentum rather than muscle contraction. 
            You're "throwing" through the motion instead of controlling it with muscles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2. Incorrect Form:</strong> If technique is wrong, you might be using the wrong muscles or 
            compensating with shoulders/jaw rather than deep neck flexors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3. Weak Mind-Muscle Connection:</strong> Your brain hasn't learned to consciously activate these 
            muscles. This skill develops with practice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>4. Range Too Small:</strong> Movement amplitude is too subtle to create noticeable muscle sensation, 
            especially in beginners.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>5. Muscle Inhibition:</strong> Chronically stretched muscles (from forward head posture) may be 
            neurologically inhibited and harder to activate initially.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>6. No Muscle Fatigue:</strong> Exercise is too easy—muscles aren't challenged enough to create 
            the "burn" sensation of fatigue.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Techniques to Improve Muscle Activation</h3>
      
      <div className="space-y-6 mb-6">
        <div className="bg-white border-2 border-green-300 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">1. Slow Down Tempo Dramatically</h4>
          <p className="mb-3 text-gray-700">
            <strong>Problem:</strong> You're doing 2-second reps when you should be doing 5-second reps.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3 text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Use this tempo for chin tucks:
          </p>
          <ul className="text-sm space-y-2 text-gray-700 list-disc pl-6">
            <li>3 seconds to tuck chin back</li>
            <li>2 seconds hold in retracted position</li>
            <li>3 seconds to return to starting position</li>
            <li>1 second rest</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700">
            This 9-second per rep tempo forces muscles to work continuously rather than using momentum.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-white border-2 border-green-300 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">2. Add Isometric Holds</h4>
          <p className="mb-3 text-gray-700">
            <strong>Problem:</strong> Muscles don't have time to fatigue during brief movements.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3 text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Hold the contracted position for 10-15 seconds:
          </p>
          <ul className="text-sm space-y-2 text-gray-700 list-disc pl-6">
            <li>Perform chin tuck normally</li>
            <li>Hold in fully retracted position for 10-15 seconds</li>
            <li>Focus on maintaining the contraction during the hold</li>
            <li>You should feel a "burn" or fatigue by the end of the hold</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-white border-2 border-green-300 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">3. Use Manual Resistance</h4>
          <p className="mb-3 text-gray-700">
            <strong>Problem:</strong> Exercise is too easy without external resistance.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3 text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Add gentle resistance with your hand:
          </p>
          <ul className="text-sm space-y-2 text-gray-700 list-disc pl-6">
            <li>Place palm on your forehead</li>
            <li>As you tuck chin, push forward with your head against your hand</li>
            <li>Your hand resists the movement (don't let head move forward)</li>
            <li>This creates isometric contraction you can clearly feel</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-white border-2 border-green-300 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">4. Touch the Working Muscles</h4>
          <p className="mb-3 text-gray-700">
            <strong>Problem:</strong> You can't sense what you can't feel physically.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3 text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Place fingers on target muscles during exercise:
          </p>
          <ul className="text-sm space-y-2 text-gray-700 list-disc pl-6">
            <li>For chin tucks: Place fingers just below jawline (deep neck flexors area)</li>
            <li>For wall angels: Touch upper back muscles between shoulder blades</li>
            <li>Feel the muscles harden/tighten during contraction</li>
            <li>This tactile feedback improves mind-muscle connection dramatically</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-white border-2 border-green-300 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">5. Visualization Technique</h4>
          <p className="mb-3 text-gray-700">
            <strong>Problem:</strong> Brain isn't actively engaging target muscles.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3 text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Mentally focus on muscles during each rep:
          </p>
          <ul className="text-sm space-y-2 text-gray-700 list-disc pl-6">
            <li>Before starting, visualize the deep neck flexors pulling your head back</li>
            <li>During the movement, think "squeeze those muscles"</li>
            <li>Imagine the muscles shortening and contracting</li>
            <li>Research shows visualization improves muscle activation by 20-30%</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-white border-2 border-green-300 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">6. Increase Repetitions for Fatigue</h4>
          <p className="mb-3 text-gray-700">
            <strong>Problem:</strong> Stopping at 10 reps before muscles fatigue.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3 text-gray-700">
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Do 20-25 reps to reach muscle fatigue:
          </p>
          <ul className="text-sm space-y-2 text-gray-700 list-disc pl-6">
            <li>You might not feel anything on reps 1-10</li>
            <li>Reps 11-15 start creating fatigue sensation</li>
            <li>Reps 16-20 should produce noticeable "burn" feeling</li>
            <li>This confirms muscles are working even if early reps felt easy</li>
          </ul>

        <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>• <strong>Mental cue:</strong> "Push chest forward through doorway"</li>
          <li>• <strong>Feeling cue:</strong> "Feel stretch across front of chest"</li>
          <li>• <strong>Muscle cue:</strong> "Sensation should be in pec muscles, not shoulders"</li>
          <li>• <strong>Check:</strong> If you feel it in shoulders, arms are positioned too high</li>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">How Long Until You Feel Muscles Working?</h3>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Most people develop better muscle activation within <strong>2-3 weeks</strong> of focused practice using the 
        techniques above. Initially, exercises may feel like "nothing is happening," but with consistent attention 
        to form, tempo, and mental focus, you'll gradually feel muscles engaging more clearly.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-6 mb-6">
        <h4 className="font-semibold text-yellow-900 mb-2">Important: Progress Is Happening Even Without "Feeling"</h4>
        <p className="text-yellow-900">
          Don't get discouraged if you don't feel much initially. Research shows that postural improvements occur 
          even when you can't consciously sense muscle activation. The "feeling" is a bonus, not a requirement. 
          As long as you're doing exercises with proper form consistently, you're benefiting.

  const faqQuestions = [
    {
      question: "Why can't I feel my neck muscles working during chin tucks?",
      answer: "You likely can't feel muscles because you're moving too fast, using incorrect form, or haven't developed mind-muscle connection yet. Slow down to 4-5 seconds per rep, place fingers under your jawline to feel muscles hardening, and add 10-second holds in the contracted position. Most people develop better activation within 2-3 weeks of focused practice."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it normal not to feel muscle burn during neck exercises?",
      answer: "Yes, especially for beginners. Deep neck flexors are small muscles that may not produce obvious 'burn' sensation initially. Try increasing to 20-25 reps, adding isometric holds, or using manual resistance. However, even without feeling a burn, exercises are still effective if done with proper form."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I improve mind-muscle connection in my neck?",
      answer: "Use these techniques: 1) Slow tempo (4-5 seconds per rep), 2) Place fingers on working muscles during exercise, 3) Visualize muscles contracting, 4) Add 10-15 second isometric holds, 5) Use manual resistance with your hand. Consistent practice for 2-3 weeks significantly improves mind-muscle connection."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I stop exercises if I can't feel muscles working?",
      answer: "No, continue exercises if form is correct. Research shows postural improvements occur even without conscious muscle sensation. The 'feeling' develops over time but isn't required for effectiveness. However, verify your form with video demonstrations or a professional to ensure you're doing exercises correctly."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to feel neck muscles activate?",
      answer: "Most people develop noticeable muscle activation within 2-3 weeks of focused practice using slow tempo, isometric holds, and mental cues. Some people feel it immediately, others take 4-6 weeks. Be patient and consistent—the feeling will come with practice."
