      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Neck Exercises Cause Stiffness</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Neck stiffness after exercises is a common experience, especially when starting a new routine or increasing intensity. 
        While it can be uncomfortable, it's usually a normal part of the muscle adaptation process. Understanding why this happens 
        and how to manage it can help you continue your posture improvement journey effectively.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        When you exercise your neck muscles, you're essentially creating small micro-tears in the muscle fibers, which is necessary 
        for muscle strengthening and growth. This process, combined with the buildup of metabolic waste products, can cause temporary 
        stiffness and soreness. The key is distinguishing between normal post-exercise stiffness and signs of overexertion or injury.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Common Causes of Post-Exercise Stiffness</h3>
      
      <div className="space-y-4 mb-6">
        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">1. Normal Muscle Adaptation (Most Common)</h4>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm">
            When you start exercising muscles that haven't been used much, they need time to adapt. This causes temporary stiffness 
            as your muscles rebuild and strengthen. This is completely normal and usually resolves within 24-48 hours.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">2. Inadequate Warm-up</h4>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm">
            Jumping into exercises without proper warm-up can cause muscle stiffness. Cold muscles are more prone to micro-tears 
            and take longer to recover, leading to increased stiffness and soreness.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">3. Overexertion or Too Much Too Soon</h4>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm">
            Doing too many repetitions, holding positions too long, or progressing too quickly can overwhelm your muscles, 
            causing excessive stiffness and delayed recovery.
          </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">4. Dehydration</h4>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm">
            Not drinking enough water before, during, or after exercise can cause muscle stiffness. Dehydrated muscles 
            don't function as efficiently and take longer to recover.
          </p>
        </div>

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">5. Poor Exercise Form</h4>
          <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm">
            Incorrect technique can strain muscles unnecessarily, causing more damage and stiffness than necessary. 
            This is why proper form is so important for neck exercises.
