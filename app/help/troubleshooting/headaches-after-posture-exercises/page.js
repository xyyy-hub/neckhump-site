      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Posture Exercises Can Cause Headaches</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Headaches after posture exercises are more common than you might think, and they can be concerning. While most exercise-related 
        headaches are harmless tension headaches, it's important to understand the causes and know when to seek medical attention. 
        The good news is that with proper technique and gradual progression, these headaches can usually be prevented.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Posture exercises often target the neck, upper back, and shoulder muscles, which are closely connected to the muscles that 
        can cause tension headaches. When these muscles are strained or overworked, they can refer pain to the head, creating 
        the familiar sensation of a tension headache.

        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">1. Muscle Tension and Strain</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Overworking neck and shoulder muscles can cause tension that radiates to the head. This is the most common cause 
            of exercise-related headaches and usually feels like a band of pressure around the head.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">2. Poor Exercise Form</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Incorrect technique can strain muscles unnecessarily, leading to tension headaches. Common form mistakes include 
            moving too fast, using too much force, or holding positions too long.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">3. Overexertion and Fatigue</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Starting with exercises that are too intense or doing too many repetitions can overwhelm your muscles, 
            leading to fatigue and subsequent headaches.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">4. Dehydration</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Not drinking enough water before, during, or after exercise can cause dehydration headaches. 
            This is especially common with neck exercises that increase blood flow to the head.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">5. Breath Holding</h4>
          <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
            Many people unconsciously hold their breath during exercises, which can increase blood pressure 
            and cause headaches. This is particularly common with isometric exercises.
