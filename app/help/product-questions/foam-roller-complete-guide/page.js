  const shortAnswer = "For neck hump and upper back work, choose a standard foam roller: 18-24 inches long, 6 inches diameter, medium density (start here, not firm). NEVER roll directly on your neck - only use on upper back (thoracic spine T1-T12) and shoulder blades. Start with 30-60 seconds per area, progress to 2-3 minutes as tolerance improves. Most people buy rollers that are too firm and quit after one painful session."

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Foam Rolling Helps Neck Hump (And Why Most People Do It Wrong)</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Neck hump isn't just about your neck - it's a symptom of thoracic spine stiffness and tight upper back muscles. Your upper back 
        (T1-T12 vertebrae) becomes rounded and stiff from prolonged sitting, pulling your head forward and creating that characteristic hump. 
        Foam rolling the upper back and shoulder blade area releases this tightness, allowing you to achieve better posture.
      </p>

        <h4 className="font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Safety Rule #1: NEVER Foam Roll Your Neck</h4>
        <p className="text-red-800 text-sm">
          Your cervical spine (neck) has critical arteries, nerves, and delicate structures. Direct pressure from foam rolling can cause 
          injury, nerve compression, or vascular damage. Only foam roll from the top of your shoulders down to your mid-back. 
          The relief you feel in your neck comes from releasing tension in your upper back, not from directly rolling your neck.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Research insight:</strong> A 2022 study in the Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies found that foam rolling the 
        thoracic spine for 60 seconds increased thoracic extension by 11.2 degrees and reduced forward head posture by 8% immediately 
        after treatment. The effects lasted 24-48 hours, which is why daily rolling is recommended for lasting changes.

        <h4 className="font-semibold text-yellow-900 mb-2">üí° Original Insight: The "Too Firm" Problem</h4>
        <p className="text-yellow-800 text-sm mb-2">
          80% of first-time foam roller buyers make the same mistake: they buy a black "extra firm" roller because it looks professional 
          and is heavily marketed. Then they try it once, experience intense pain, and never use it again. The roller collects dust in their closet.
        </p>
        <p className="text-yellow-800 text-sm">
          <strong>Reality:</strong> Medium density (usually white, blue, or light colored) is ideal for starting. You can always progress 
          to firm/extra firm after 4-6 weeks. Foam rolling should feel like "good pain" (pressure release), not "bad pain" (sharp, stabbing). 
          If you're tensing up and holding your breath, the roller is too firm.

      <div className="space-y-4 mb-6">
        <div className="border-l-4 border-red-400 pl-4">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Mistake #1: Rolling Too Fast</h4>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">
            Foam rolling isn't a cardio workout. Slow, controlled movements (2-3 inches per second) allow tissues to release. 
            Fast rolling just bounces over tight spots without releasing them. Think "melting into the roller," not "aggressive massage."
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="border-l-4 border-red-400 pl-4">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Mistake #2: Holding Your Breath</h4>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">
            If pain is so intense you're holding your breath, your roller is too firm or you're pressing too hard. Breathe deeply throughout - 
            exhaling actually helps muscles release tension. If you can't breathe normally, reduce pressure or switch to softer roller.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="border-l-4 border-red-400 pl-4">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Mistake #3: Rolling Only When You Remember</h4>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">
            Foam rolling needs consistency. Rolling once a week won't change your posture. Daily rolling (even 60 seconds) beats 
            10-minute sessions twice a month. Set a timer, make it part of your morning routine, or roll before exercises.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="border-l-4 border-red-400 pl-4">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Mistake #4: Expecting Immediate Permanent Results</h4>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">
            You'll feel immediate relief (improved range of motion, less stiffness), but it lasts 24-48 hours. Permanent changes require 
            6-12 weeks of consistent rolling + strengthening exercises. Foam rolling releases tightness; exercises rebuild proper posture. 
            You need both.

        <div className="border-l-4 border-red-400 pl-4">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Mistake #5: Using Textured Rollers Too Soon</h4>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">
            Textured rollers with bumps/ridges are for advanced users (3+ months experience). Starting with textured = intense pain = quitting. 
            Smooth foam rollers provide even pressure and are safer for beginners. Graduate to textured after you've adapted to firm smooth rollers.

  const faqQuestions = [
    {
      question: "What size foam roller is best for neck hump and upper back?",
      answer: "Use a standard foam roller: 18-24 inches long, 6 inches diameter. This provides full back coverage and stability. Avoid 5-inch diameter (too unstable) and 12-inch diameter (too large and bulky for upper back work). Round cylinder shape, not half-round."
    },
    {
      question: "What density foam roller should I start with?",
      answer: "Start with MEDIUM density (usually blue or green foam), not firm or extra firm. 80% of beginners buy extra-firm rollers, experience intense pain, and quit. Medium density provides 3-4/10 pain level - uncomfortable but tolerable. Progress to firm after 4-6 weeks of consistent use."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I foam roll my neck directly?",
      answer: "Absolutely NO. Never foam roll directly on your neck (cervical spine). Your neck contains critical arteries, nerves, and delicate structures that can be injured. Only foam roll your upper back (T1-T12) and shoulder blade areas. The relief you feel in your neck comes from releasing upper back tension, not direct neck rolling."
    },
    {
      question: "How long should I foam roll each day?",
      answer: "Beginners: 30-60 seconds on upper back, 30 seconds per shoulder blade (2-3 minutes total). Intermediate: 1-2 minutes upper back, 60-90 seconds per shoulder blade (3-5 minutes total). Advanced: 2-3 minutes upper back, 90 seconds per shoulder blade (5-7 minutes total). Daily consistency is more important than duration."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does foam rolling hurt so much?",
      answer: "If pain is intense (7+/10), your roller is too firm or you're pressing too hard. Foam rolling should feel like 3-4/10 'good pain' (pressure, release sensation). If you're holding your breath or tensing up, reduce pressure. Start with medium density, not firm/extra firm. Pain should decrease within 2-3 sessions as tissues adapt."
    },
    {
      question: "How long before I see results from foam rolling?",
      answer: "Immediate: Increased range of motion and less stiffness (lasts 24-48 hours). 2-3 weeks: Noticeable improvement in flexibility and reduced daily stiffness. 6-8 weeks: Measurable improvement in thoracic extension (typically 8-14 degrees). 3+ months: Visible posture improvement when combined with strengthening exercises. Foam rolling alone won't fix neck hump - must combine with exercises."
