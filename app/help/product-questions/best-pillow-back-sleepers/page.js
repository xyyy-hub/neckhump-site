      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Pillow Choice Matters for Back Sleepers</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Back sleeping is considered the best position for spinal health, but only when you have the right pillow support. The ideal 
        pillow for back sleepers should maintain the natural curve of your neck while keeping your head in a neutral position. 
        This prevents your head from tilting forward (which worsens neck hump) or backward (which can cause neck strain).
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The key is finding a pillow that's thick enough to fill the natural gap between your head and the mattress, but not so thick 
        that it pushes your head forward. This balance is crucial for preventing and correcting neck hump while ensuring comfortable, 
        restful sleep.
