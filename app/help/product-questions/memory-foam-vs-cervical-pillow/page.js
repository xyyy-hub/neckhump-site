      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Memory Foam vs Cervical Pillow: The Key Differences</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Choosing between memory foam and cervical pillows for neck hump correction depends on your sleep position, 
        specific needs, and preferences. Both have distinct advantages and disadvantages that can significantly 
        impact your neck alignment and overall sleep quality.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The main difference lies in their design philosophy: cervical pillows are specifically engineered to support 
        the natural curve of your cervical spine, while memory foam pillows focus on comfort and pressure relief. 
        For neck hump correction, proper spinal alignment is more important than comfort alone.

      question: "Which is better for neck hump: memory foam or cervical pillow?",
      answer: "Cervical pillows are generally better for neck hump correction because they're specifically designed to support the natural curve of your cervical spine. Memory foam pillows often lack proper height and can cause forward head posture, though high-quality memory foam with proper height (4-6 inches) can work for side sleepers."
    },
    {
      question: "Why are memory foam pillows often bad for neck alignment?",
      answer: "Memory foam pillows are often too low and compress too much under head weight, causing your head to tilt forward and creating forward head posture. They're designed for comfort and pressure relief rather than proper spinal alignment."
    },
    {
      question: "Can memory foam pillows work for neck hump if they're the right height?",
      answer: "Yes, high-quality memory foam pillows with proper height (4-6 inches for side sleepers) and firm density can work for neck hump correction. The key is ensuring they maintain their height under head weight and provide adequate support."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes cervical pillows better for neck support?",
      answer: "Cervical pillows are specifically engineered to support the natural curve of your cervical spine. They often have adjustable height, targeted support areas, and are designed to maintain proper neck alignment rather than just providing comfort."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to get used to a cervical pillow?",
      answer: "Most people need 2-3 weeks to adjust to a cervical pillow, as they often feel firmer and more structured than traditional pillows. The initial discomfort usually subsides as your neck muscles adapt to the proper alignment."
