      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Laptop Stands Are Essential for Neck Health</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Laptops are designed for portability, not ergonomics. When you work directly on a laptop placed on a desk, 
        the screen sits far too low, forcing you to look down. This creates forward head posture—for every inch your 
        head moves forward, it adds 10 pounds of strain on your neck muscles. Over time, this leads to tech neck 
        and visible neck hump.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        A laptop stand solves this by raising the screen to eye level, allowing you to maintain neutral neck alignment. 
        Research shows that proper screen height can reduce neck strain by up to 50% during extended computer use. 
        However, the stand must have specific features to be truly effective.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">How High Should Your Laptop Stand Be?</h3>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The correct height depends on your sitting position and eye level. When set up properly:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>The <strong>top third</strong> of your laptop screen should be at eye level</li>
        <li>Your neck should be neutral (not tilted up or down) when looking at the center of the screen</li>
        <li>The screen should be 20-26 inches from your eyes (arm's length)</li>
        <li>You should be able to see the screen without moving your head</li>
      </ul>

      <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-4 mb-6">
        <p className="text-yellow-900">
          <strong>Important:</strong> Most people need to raise their laptop 5-10 inches off the desk surface. 
          If you're tall (over 6'0"), you may need 10-15 inches of elevation. Test different heights to find 
          what keeps your neck neutral.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">External Keyboard & Mouse Are Non-Negotiable</h3>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Here's the catch: when you raise your laptop to eye level, the keyboard is now at chest/face level—completely 
        unusable for typing. This is why <strong>you must use an external keyboard and mouse</strong> with any laptop stand.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Trying to type on a raised laptop causes severe shoulder and arm strain. The external keyboard should sit at 
        desk level with your elbows at 90 degrees and wrists neutral.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Common Laptop Stand Mistakes</h3>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Not elevating high enough:</strong> Screen still below eye level, still looking down</li>
        <li><strong>Typing on the elevated laptop:</strong> Causes shoulder and wrist strain</li>
        <li><strong>Screen too close:</strong> Should be arm's length away, not 12 inches from your face</li>
        <li><strong>Unstable stand:</strong> Wobbles when you touch it, causing eye strain from screen movement</li>
        <li><strong>Blocking ventilation:</strong> Closed stand design causes laptop overheating and performance issues</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Budget Alternatives</h3>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        If you can't invest in a laptop stand immediately, you can temporarily use:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Stack of books or textbooks (ensure stable and level)</li>
        <li>Reams of printer paper</li>
        <li>Shoebox or storage box (check stability)</li>
        <li>Monitor riser with laptop placed on top</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4">
        These temporary solutions work for testing the right height, but invest in a proper stand for long-term use 
        as makeshift solutions can be unstable and dangerous.

      question: "What is the best laptop stand for posture?",
      answer: "The best laptop stand for posture is height-adjustable (10-15 inches range), stable, and has good ventilation. Aluminum adjustable stands like the Roost Stand or Rain Design mStand are popular because they offer flexibility for different heights and desk setups."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need an external keyboard with a laptop stand?",
      answer: "Yes, an external keyboard and mouse are absolutely required when using a laptop stand. When the laptop is raised to eye level, the built-in keyboard is at chest/face level and unusable for typing. Trying to type on a raised laptop causes severe shoulder strain."
    },
    {
      question: "How high should I raise my laptop?",
      answer: "Raise your laptop so the top third of the screen is at eye level when sitting upright. For most people, this means elevating the laptop 5-10 inches off the desk. Taller people may need 10-15 inches. The screen should be at arm's length (20-26 inches) from your eyes."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use books instead of buying a laptop stand?",
      answer: "Books can work as a temporary solution for testing the right height, but they're not ideal long-term. They can be unstable, block ventilation, and look unprofessional. If budget is a concern, start with books to test, then invest in a proper stand ($20-40) for safety and stability."
    },
    {
      question: "Will a laptop stand fix my neck hump?",
      answer: "A laptop stand helps prevent worsening of neck hump by maintaining proper screen height, but it won't fix existing neck hump alone. You need to combine proper laptop ergonomics with corrective exercises like chin tucks, wall angels, and strengthening exercises for lasting results."
