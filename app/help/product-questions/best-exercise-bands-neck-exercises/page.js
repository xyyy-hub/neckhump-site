      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Exercise Bands Are Great for Neck Exercises</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Exercise bands (resistance bands) are excellent tools for neck and upper back strengthening because they provide variable 
        resistance that can be easily adjusted to your fitness level. Unlike weights, bands offer smooth, controlled resistance 
        that's gentler on joints and can be used in multiple directions, making them ideal for neck hump correction exercises.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The key advantage of resistance bands for neck exercises is their ability to provide progressive resistance without the 
        risk of dropping weights on yourself. They're also portable, affordable, and can be used anywhere, making them perfect 
        for home workouts or travel. However, choosing the right resistance level and band type is crucial for safety and effectiveness.

          <li>• <strong>Use proper anchoring:</strong> Ensure bands are securely anchored to prevent snapping back</li>
          <li>• <strong>Check bands regularly:</strong> Inspect for tears or wear before each use</li>
