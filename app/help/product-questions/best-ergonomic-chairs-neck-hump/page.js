      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How Ergonomic Chairs Help with Neck Hump</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A good ergonomic chair is one of the most important investments you can make for preventing and correcting neck hump. 
        Since most people spend 6-8 hours daily sitting at work, your chair plays a crucial role in maintaining proper posture 
        and reducing the strain that leads to forward head posture and neck hump.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The right ergonomic chair supports your entire spine in a neutral position, reducing the need to compensate with poor 
        posture. When your lower back, mid-back, and neck are properly supported, you're less likely to develop the muscle 
        imbalances and postural habits that contribute to neck hump.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Essential Features for Neck Hump Prevention</h3>
      
      <div className="space-y-4 mb-6">
        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">1. Adjustable Lumbar Support</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Proper lumbar support maintains the natural curve of your lower spine, which helps 
            keep your entire spine aligned and prevents the forward slouching that leads to neck hump.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>What to look for:</strong> Adjustable height and depth lumbar support that fits your specific spine curvature.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">2. Proper Seat Height Adjustment</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Correct seat height ensures your feet are flat on the floor with knees at 90 degrees, 
            promoting proper hip alignment that supports good posture throughout your spine.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>What to look for:</strong> Easy height adjustment mechanism that allows you to find the perfect position for your body.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">3. Adjustable Armrests</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Proper armrest height prevents shoulder elevation and tension that can contribute 
            to neck and upper back problems. They should support your arms without forcing your shoulders up.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>What to look for:</strong> Height-adjustable armrests that can be positioned to support your arms at 90-degree angles.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">4. Headrest for Neck Support</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why it matters:</strong> A properly positioned headrest supports your neck and head, reducing the strain 
            on your cervical spine and helping maintain neutral head position.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>What to look for:</strong> Adjustable headrest that can be positioned to support your head without pushing it forward.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">5. Seat Depth Adjustment</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Proper seat depth ensures your back is fully supported against the backrest while 
            leaving 2-4 inches between the seat edge and the back of your knees.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>What to look for:</strong> Adjustable seat depth or multiple seat size options to fit your body proportions.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">6. Recline Function</h4>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm mb-2">
            <strong>Why it matters:</strong> The ability to recline slightly (100-110 degrees) reduces pressure on your spine 
            and allows you to change positions throughout the day, preventing muscle fatigue and poor posture.
          </p>
          <p className="text-green-800 text-sm">
            <strong>What to look for:</strong> Smooth recline mechanism with multiple lock positions and good back support in all positions.
