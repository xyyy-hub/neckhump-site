Measure your shoulder-to-ear distance while lying on your side - this is your ideal pillow height.

      <p className="mb-4">
        Side sleeping is the most popular sleep position (accounting for 60% of sleepers), but it creates unique challenges 
        for maintaining proper cervical alignment. When you sleep on your side, there's a natural gap between your head and 
        the mattress - typically 4-7 inches depending on shoulder width. Without proper support, your head either:
      </p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Drops down</strong> (pillow too thin) ‚Üí Strains neck muscles, worsens forward head posture</li>
        <li><strong>Tilts upward</strong> (pillow too thick) ‚Üí Creates unnatural cervical curve, contributes to neck hump</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Research insight:</strong> A 2023 study in the Journal of Physical Therapy Science found that side sleepers 
        with incorrect pillow height showed 34% greater cervical spine misalignment and reported 2.3x more morning neck stiffness 
        compared to those using properly sized pillows. Getting this right isn't optional - it's foundational to neck hump correction.

        <p className="text-yellow-800 text-sm">
          Ever notice your neck feels better in hotels? Many hotels use 2-3 medium-thickness pillows stacked. Why it works: 
          You can remove or add pillows throughout the night as your body position changes. At home, invest in ONE properly 
          sized cervical pillow rather than stacking multiple generic pillows - it provides consistent support regardless of 
          how you shift position.

            "Side sleeper pillow" is too generic. Two side sleepers with 14-inch vs 18-inch shoulders need completely different pillows.

          <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">
            A "6-inch loft" pillow might compress to 4.5 inches under your head weight. Always check "compressed height" specs or buy

            If you've been using the wrong pillow for years, the correct pillow will feel "weird" initially. Your neck muscles have adapted

            <strong>The Mirror Test:</strong> Have someone take a photo of you lying on your side with your pillow.

            <strong>The Morning Stiffness Test:</strong> If you wake up with neck stiffness that improves after 30 minutes of being upright,

          <li className="text-gray-800">
            <strong>The Hand Gap Test:</strong> Slide your hand between the mattress and your neck while lying on your side. 
            If there's a gap larger than 1 inch, your pillow is too low. If your hand doesn't fit at all, pillow is too high.

    {
      question: "What is the ideal pillow height for side sleepers with neck hump?",
      answer: "The ideal pillow height is 4-6 inches (compressed height) for most side sleepers, but it varies based on shoulder width. Measure your shoulder-to-ear distance while lying on your side - this is your true need. Broader shoulders (>16 inches) need 5.5-7 inch pillows, while narrower shoulders (<14 inches) need 3.5-4.5 inch pillows."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if my pillow is too high or too low?",
      answer: "Do the mirror test: have someone photograph you lying on your side. Draw a line from your ear through your spine. If your head tilts up, pillow is too high. If it tilts down, too low. Also check for morning stiffness (wrong height) and do the hand gap test (>1 inch gap under neck = too low)."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the best pillow material for side sleepers with neck issues?",
      answer: "Memory foam with cervical contour is best for most people (consistent support, maintains shape). Latex is excellent for hot sleepers and those who change positions. Adjustable shredded memory foam works well for finding your exact height. Avoid traditional down/feather pillows - they compress too much overnight."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to adjust to a new pillow?",
      answer: "Give it 7-10 days for your neck muscles to adapt to proper alignment. The correct pillow often feels 'weird' initially because your muscles adapted to poor posture. However, if you experience sharp pain, stop immediately. Mild discomfort that gradually improves is normal adaptation."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to replace my pillow if I change mattresses?",
      answer: "Yes, often. Softer mattresses let your shoulder sink more (need shorter pillow). Firmer mattresses compress shoulders less (need taller pillow). Re-measure your shoulder-to-ear distance on your new mattress to determine if your pillow height still works."
    },
    {
      question: "Can the wrong pillow actually cause neck hump?",
      answer: "Yes. A 2023 study found side sleepers with incorrect pillow height showed 34% greater cervical spine misalignment overnight. If your head tilts downward (pillow too thin) for 7-8 hours nightly over months/years, it reinforces forward head posture and contributes to neck hump development."
