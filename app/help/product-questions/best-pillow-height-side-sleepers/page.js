      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Pillow Height Matters for Side Sleepers</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Side sleeping is the most common sleep position, but it's also the most challenging for maintaining proper neck alignment. 
        When you sleep on your side, your head needs to be supported at the right height to keep your cervical spine in its 
        natural curve. The wrong pillow height can worsen neck hump and forward head posture.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Research shows that side sleepers need significantly more pillow height than back or stomach sleepers because of the 
        distance between the head and shoulder. Without proper support, your head will either sag down (causing neck strain) 
        or be pushed up too high (creating forward head posture).
      </p>

        <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Recommended Height: 4-6 inches</h4>
        <p className="mb-3">
          The ideal pillow height for side sleepers is 4-6 inches thick when compressed under the weight of your head. 
          This measurement should be taken from the bottom of the pillow to the top of your head when lying on your side.
        </p>
        
        <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">How to Measure Your Ideal Height</h4>
        <p className="mb-3">
          Measure the distance from your shoulder to your ear while lying on your side. Your pillow should be approximately 
          this height to maintain neutral neck alignment. Most people need 4-6 inches, but this can vary based on shoulder width.

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Shoulder Width:</strong> Broader shoulders need taller pillows to fill the gap</li>
        <li><strong>Neck Length:</strong> Longer necks may need slightly more height</li>
        <li><strong>Mattress Firmness:</strong> Softer mattresses compress more, requiring taller pillows</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep Position Variations:</strong> If you move between side and back, consider adjustable pillows</li>
        <li><strong>Existing Neck Problems:</strong> Those with neck hump may need extra support</li>

    {
      question: "What is the best pillow height for side sleepers?",
      answer: "The best pillow height for side sleepers is 4-6 inches thick when compressed under your head. This should fill the gap between your head and shoulder, keeping your neck in neutral alignment."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if my pillow is too high or too low?",
      answer: "If your pillow is too low, you'll wake up with neck pain and your head will tilt down toward your shoulder. If it's too high, you'll have forward head posture and neck stiffness. The right height keeps your head level with your spine."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I use a different pillow height if I have neck hump?",
      answer: "Yes, people with neck hump often need slightly more support to maintain proper alignment. Consider a pillow on the higher end of the 4-6 inch range, but ensure it still keeps your neck in neutral position."
    },
    {
      question: "What pillow firmness is best for side sleepers?",
      answer: "Side sleepers need firm support that maintains its height under head weight. Look for medium-firm to firm pillows that don't collapse completely but are still comfortable to sleep on."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use the same pillow height for both sides?",
      answer: "Yes, most people can use the same pillow height for both sides, but if you have significantly different shoulder heights or neck issues, you might need to adjust your sleeping position or use an adjustable pillow."
