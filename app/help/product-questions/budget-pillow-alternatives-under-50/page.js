      <p className="mb-4">
        You don't need to spend hundreds of dollars on a pillow to improve your neck hump. Many effective alternatives exist 
        under $50 that can provide proper neck support and alignment. The key is understanding what makes a pillow effective 
        for neck hump correction and finding budget-friendly options that meet those criteria.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The most important factors for neck hump correction are proper height (4-6 inches for side sleepers), adequate firmness 
        to maintain support, and the ability to maintain your neck's natural curve. Many expensive pillows focus on luxury features 
        that don't necessarily improve neck alignment.
