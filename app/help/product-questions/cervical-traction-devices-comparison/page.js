      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What Is Cervical Traction?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Cervical traction is a therapy that gently pulls (tracts) your head away from your neck, creating space 
        between cervical vertebrae. This decompression can relieve pressure on spinal nerves, reduce muscle spasm, 
        and improve neck alignment. While physical therapists and chiropractors traditionally performed traction, 
        home devices now make it accessible for self-treatment.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        For people with neck hump and forward head posture, cervical traction can provide temporary relief from 
        muscle tension and pain. However, traction alone won't fix postural problems—you must combine it with 
        strengthening exercises and ergonomic improvements for lasting results.
      </p>

        <h4 className="font-semibold text-yellow-900 mb-2">⚠️ Important Safety Note</h4>
        <p className="text-yellow-900">
          Cervical traction is not appropriate for everyone. Do NOT use traction if you have rheumatoid arthritis, 
          osteoporosis, spinal cord compression, acute injuries, or cancer affecting the spine. Always consult a 
          healthcare provider before starting cervical traction at home.

          <p className="mb-3">
            <strong>Best for:</strong> Beginners, mild to moderate neck pain, portability
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 text-red-800">
            <strong>Why avoid:</strong> Homemade traction devices using ropes, weights, or improvised harnesses are 
            dangerous. They lack safety mechanisms and can cause serious neck injuries including nerve damage, 
            muscle tears, and vertebral dislocation.

          <p className="text-sm text-red-800">
            Commercial traction devices have safety features like quick-release mechanisms and controlled force. 
            The $20-40 cost of a proper device is worth avoiding potential neck injury.

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Start slow:</strong> Begin with 5-10 minutes of light traction, gradually increase</li>
        <li><strong>Low force first:</strong> Use minimal weight/inflation initially, increase over weeks</li>
        <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 1-2 times daily, not more than 20 minutes per session</li>
        <li><strong>Position:</strong> Sitting upright or lying flat, never standing</li>
        <li><strong>Stop if pain increases:</strong> Mild discomfort is normal initially, but sharp pain means stop</li>
        <li><strong>Combine with exercises:</strong> Use traction before doing chin tucks and stretching</li>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Does Cervical Traction Fix Neck Hump?</h3>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Cervical traction provides temporary relief from neck pain and muscle tension associated with forward head 
        posture, but it won't permanently fix neck hump on its own. Think of traction as pain relief and muscle 
        relaxation, not as a cure.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        To actually correct neck hump, you need:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Strengthening exercises (chin tucks, wall angels)</li>
        <li>Stretching tight chest and neck muscles</li>
        <li>Ergonomic improvements (desk setup, pillow height)</li>
        <li>Posture awareness and correction</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Traction can be a helpful addition to this comprehensive approach by providing relief that makes exercises 
        easier to perform and reducing pain that interferes with posture correction.

If you need stronger traction or have been prescribed traction by a healthcare provider, over-door units ($30-60) or electronic devices ($200+) may be more appropriate."

      question: "Is cervical traction safe to do at home?",
      answer: "Cervical traction can be safe at home when done correctly and after consulting with a healthcare provider. However, it's not safe for everyone—avoid traction if you have osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, spinal cord compression, or recent neck injuries. Always start with minimal force and short duration (5-10 minutes)."
    },
    {
      question: "How long should I use cervical traction each day?",
      answer: "Start with 5-10 minutes once daily for the first week. Gradually increase to 15-20 minutes once or twice daily over several weeks. Never exceed 20 minutes per session. Most people find 10-15 minutes of traction 1-2 times daily provides optimal relief without overdoing it."

    {
      question: "What's the difference between inflatable collars and over-door traction?",
      answer: "Inflatable collars are portable, easier to use, and provide gentler traction through air inflation. Over-door units use weighted pulleys for stronger, more traditional traction force. Beginners should start with inflatable collars ($20-40) as they're safer and more forgiving. Over-door units ($30-60) are better for those who need stronger traction or have been prescribed traction by a healthcare provider."
