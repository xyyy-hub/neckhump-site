      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Choosing the Right Foam Roller for Neck and Upper Back</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Foam rollers can be excellent tools for relieving tension in your upper back and shoulders, which often contribute to neck hump 
        and forward head posture. However, choosing the wrong size or density can make exercises ineffective or even cause injury. 
        Understanding the different options will help you select the best foam roller for your needs.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Important Safety Note:</strong> Never use a foam roller directly on your neck. The neck is too delicate and can be easily 
        injured. Instead, use foam rollers for your upper back, shoulder blades, and thoracic spine area, which can help relieve 
        tension that contributes to neck problems.
