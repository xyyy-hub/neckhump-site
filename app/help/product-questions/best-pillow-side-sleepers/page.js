      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Pillow Choice Matters for Side Sleepers</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Side sleeping is the most popular sleep position, but it requires careful pillow selection to maintain proper spinal alignment. 
        When you sleep on your side, your head needs to be supported at the same height as your shoulder to keep your spine in a 
        neutral position. This prevents your head from tilting up or down, which can worsen neck hump and cause muscle strain.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The ideal pillow for side sleepers should fill the natural gap between your head and shoulder while providing enough support 
        to maintain this alignment throughout the night. This balance is crucial for preventing and correcting neck hump while ensuring 
        comfortable, restful sleep.
