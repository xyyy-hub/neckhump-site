        <h2 id="why-posture-bad">Why Your Posture Got Bad</h2>
        <p>
          Before we fix the problem, let's understand what caused it. Modern life has created a perfect storm for poor posture:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Prolonged sitting:</strong> Your hip flexors tighten and glutes weaken, creating an anterior pelvic tilt</li>
          <li><strong>Screen time:</strong> Looking down at phones and computers causes forward head posture</li>
          <li><strong>Weak core:</strong> Without strong stabilizing muscles, your body compensates with poor alignment</li>
          <li><strong>Rounded shoulders:</strong> Chest muscles tighten while upper back muscles stretch and weaken</li>
          <li><strong>Sedentary lifestyle:</strong> Lack of movement allows these imbalances to become permanent</li>
        </ul>

        <div className="bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-yellow-800 mb-2">
            Quick Posture Check
          </h3>
          <p className="text-yellow-700">
            Stand against a wall with your back flat. If your head doesn't touch the wall naturally, 
            you likely have forward head posture. If there's a large gap at your lower back, you may have anterior pelvic tilt.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="four-step-system">The 4-Step Posture Fix System</h2>
        <p>
          This proven system addresses posture problems systematically. Follow these steps in order for best results:
        </p>

        <h3>Step 1: Awareness Check (Week 1)</h3>
        <p>
          You can't fix what you don't notice. Start by becoming aware of your posture throughout the day:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Set hourly reminders:</strong> Use your phone to check posture every hour</li>
          <li><strong>Notice trigger moments:</strong> When do you slouch? After meals? During meetings?</li>
          <li><strong>Take photos:</strong> Have someone photograph you from the side while sitting and standing</li>
          <li><strong>Mirror check:</strong> Glance at your reflection in windows and mirrors throughout the day</li>
          <li><strong>Body scan:</strong> Do a quick mental scan from head to toe several times daily</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 2: Strengthen These Key Muscles (Week 2-4)</h3>
        <p>
          Focus on strengthening the muscles that support good posture. These exercises require no equipment:
        </p>

        <h4>Upper Back and Rear Delts</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Wall slides:</strong> Stand with back against wall, slide arms up and down. 3 sets of 10 reps daily</li>
          <li><strong>Band pull-aparts:</strong> Use resistance band or towel. 3 sets of 15 reps</li>
          <li><strong>Prone Y-raises:</strong> Lie face down, lift arms in Y shape. 3 sets of 10 reps</li>
          <li><strong>Superman holds:</strong> Lie face down, lift chest and arms. Hold 10 seconds, 3 sets</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Core Stability</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dead bug:</strong> Lie on back, opposite arm/leg movements. 3 sets of 8 each side</li>
          <li><strong>Bird dog:</strong> On hands and knees, extend opposite arm/leg. 3 sets of 8 each side</li>
          <li><strong>Modified plank:</strong> Hold for 30-60 seconds, 3 times</li>
          <li><strong>Pallof press:</strong> Use resistance band or towel for anti-rotation. 3 sets of 10 each side</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Glutes and Hip Stability</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Glute bridges:</strong> Lie on back, lift hips. 3 sets of 15 reps</li>
          <li><strong>Clamshells:</strong> Side-lying hip abduction. 3 sets of 12 each side</li>
          <li><strong>Wall sits:</strong> Back against wall, hold squat position. 30-60 seconds, 3 sets</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 3: Stretch These Tight Areas (Daily)</h3>
        <p>
          Counteract the tightness caused by poor posture with targeted stretches:
        </p>

        <h4>Chest and Front Shoulders</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Doorway chest stretch:</strong> Arm against doorframe, step forward. Hold 30 seconds, 3 times each arm</li>
          <li><strong>Corner chest stretch:</strong> Both arms against corner walls. Hold 30 seconds, 3 times</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-body shoulder stretch:</strong> Pull arm across chest. 30 seconds each side</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Neck and Upper Traps</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Chin tucks:</strong> Pull chin back, lengthen neck. 10 reps every hour</li>
          <li><strong>Upper trap stretch:</strong> Ear to shoulder, hold 30 seconds each side, 3 times</li>
          <li><strong>Levator scapulae stretch:</strong> Look down and away from tight side. 30 seconds each side</li>
          <li><strong>Neck rotations:</strong> Gentle side-to-side and up-down movements. 10 each direction</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Hip Flexors and Lower Back</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Couch stretch:</strong> Rear foot elevated, front leg forward. 2 minutes each leg</li>
          <li><strong>Low lunge:</strong> Step forward into lunge, hold stretch. 30 seconds each side, 3 times</li>
          <li><strong>Cat-cow stretches:</strong> On hands and knees, arch and round spine. 10 reps</li>
          <li><strong>Child's pose:</strong> Sit back on heels, arms forward. Hold 30 seconds</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 4: Optimize Your Environment</h3>
        <p>
          Make it easier to maintain good posture by fixing your workspace:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Monitor height:</strong> Top of screen at or slightly below eye level</li>
          <li><strong>Keyboard position:</strong> Elbows at 90 degrees, wrists neutral</li>
          <li><strong>Chair setup:</strong> Feet flat on floor, knees at 90 degrees, back supported</li>
          <li><strong>Phone use:</strong> Bring device to eye level instead of looking down</li>
          <li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Reduce glare and eye strain that causes forward head posture</li>
          <li><strong>Movement breaks:</strong> Stand and walk for 2 minutes every 30 minutes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="daily-routine">5-Minute Daily Routine</h2>
        <p>
          Do this routine every morning to activate good posture muscles and set yourself up for success:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Chin tucks:</strong> 10 reps (1 minute)</li>
          <li><strong>Wall slides:</strong> 10 reps (1 minute)</li>
          <li><strong>Cat-cow stretches:</strong> 10 reps (1 minute)</li>
          <li><strong>Hip flexor stretch:</strong> 30 seconds each side (1 minute)</li>
          <li><strong>Glute bridges:</strong> 10 reps (1 minute)</li>
        </ol>

        <div className="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-green-800 mb-2">
            Pro Tip: Start Small
          </h3>
          <p className="text-green-700">
            Don't try to do everything at once. Start with just the 5-minute morning routine for the first week, 
            then gradually add strengthening exercises and longer stretches.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="common-mistakes">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Overcorrecting:</strong> Don't force an unnatural "military" posture—aim for neutral alignment</li>
          <li><strong>Ignoring breaks:</strong> Take movement breaks every 30 minutes, not just at lunch</li>
          <li><strong>Focusing only on exercises:</strong> Your daily habits and workspace setup matter more</li>
          <li><strong>Expecting instant results:</strong> Real postural change takes 4-6 weeks of consistency</li>
          <li><strong>Neglecting sleep posture:</strong> Use proper pillows and mattress support</li>
          <li><strong>Working through pain:</strong> Mild discomfort is normal, sharp pain is not</li>
        </ul>

        <div className="space-y-6">
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">How long does it take to fix bad posture?</h3>
            <p>
              Most people see noticeable improvement in 2-4 weeks with consistent daily exercises. Significant posture changes typically occur within 6-8 weeks, while complete correction may take 3-6 months depending on severity and individual factors. Consistency is more important than intensity.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Can you fix posture without equipment?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes, most effective posture exercises require no equipment. Bodyweight exercises like chin tucks, wall slides, hip flexor stretches, and glute bridges can significantly improve posture. A wall, chair, and floor are all you need to get started.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">What causes bad posture?</h3>
            <p>
              Bad posture is typically caused by prolonged sitting, poor ergonomics, weak core and back muscles, tight chest and hip flexors, stress, and lack of movement. Desk work, phone use, and sedentary lifestyle are major contributing factors.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">How often should I do posture exercises?</h3>
            <p>
              Aim for 5-15 minutes of posture exercises daily for best results. Consistency is more important than intensity - doing 5 minutes every day is better than 30 minutes once a week. You can also break it into smaller sessions throughout the day.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Can bad posture cause health problems?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes, poor posture can lead to back pain, neck pain, headaches, reduced lung capacity, digestive issues, and increased risk of injury. It can also cause muscle imbalances, joint problems, and chronic pain conditions.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">What's the best desk setup for good posture?</h3>
            <p>
              Position your monitor at eye level, keep your feet flat on the floor, maintain 90-degree angles at elbows and knees, use a chair with lumbar support, and keep your keyboard and mouse close to your body. Take breaks every hour to stand and move.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Can posture exercises help with back pain?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes, posture exercises often reduce back pain by strengthening supporting muscles and improving alignment. However, if you have severe or persistent pain, consult a healthcare provider before starting any exercise program.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Is it normal to feel sore after posture exercises?</h3>
            <p>
              Mild muscle soreness is normal when starting posture exercises, especially in previously weak muscles. However, sharp pain, numbness, or tingling are warning signs to stop and consult a professional.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Can teenagers fix their posture?</h3>
            <p>
              Absolutely! Teenagers can often fix posture faster than adults because their bodies are still developing. Focus on awareness, daily stretching, and limiting screen time. Early intervention prevents long-term problems.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">What if posture exercises make my pain worse?</h3>
            <p>
              Stop immediately if exercises increase pain. This may indicate you're doing too much too soon, using incorrect form, or have an underlying issue. Start with gentler stretches and consider professional guidance.
