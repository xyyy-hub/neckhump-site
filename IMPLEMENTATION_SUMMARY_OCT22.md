## üìù Notes & Observations

### What Went Well
1. **Systematic Approach:** Started with high-impression, underperforming keywords
2. **Low-Hanging Fruit:** Created dedicated page for keyword already ranking without page (corrector pillows)
3. **Schema Enhancement:** Added 37 Q&A pairs across 5 pages for rich snippet potential
4. **Clean Implementation:** Zero broken links, zero linting errors, no technical debt

### Challenges Identified
1. **Visual Content Gap:** No exercise images/illustrations (high-priority fix needed)
2. **Orphan Pages:** 24 help center pages need better internal linking
3. **Traffic Baseline:** Very low starting point (6 clicks/month) means progress will be slow initially
4. **Content Volume:** Competitors likely have 50-100+ pages, we have ~25 main pages

### Key Learnings
1. **Keyword Variations Matter:** "Y-T-W" vs "YTW" vs "YWT" - search different things
2. **Dedicated Pages Win:** Even ranking 8-14 WITHOUT a page means huge opportunity with proper targeting
3. **FAQ Schema Works:** Structured Q&A format perfect for both users and search engines
4. **Internal Linking Critical:** New pages need 5+ internal links to gain authority quickly
