## üéØ **Why This Approach**

**Question:** "From an SEO/AEO perspective, are these components helpful?"

**Answer:** **YES** - but only when strategically placed (not randomly).

### **Strategic Deployment Decisions:**

**‚úÖ Deployed to 4 pages** (not all 25):
- High-traffic pages that can amplify benefits
- Hub pages that naturally distribute traffic
- Comprehensive content worthy of related articles

**‚úÖ NavigationPathway on only 2 pages**:
- Journey-focused pages where linear progression makes sense
- Avoid overuse (dilutes effectiveness)

**‚úÖ Carefully selected related articles**:
- 3-5 per page (not overwhelming)
- Complementary content (answers "what next?")
- Mix of categories (exercises, prevention, treatment)
