## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULES (Never Forget)

### Rule 1: Check Keyword Mapping FIRST
ALWAYS check `KEYWORD_MAPPING_MASTER.md` before writing ANY article. This prevents cannibalization.

### Rule 2: Zero Content Duplication
Run Copyscape on EVERY article before publishing. Must be 100% unique.

### Rule 3: Different Angles for Overlap
If same topic on both domains, use completely different:
- Outlines
- Examples  
- Tone (medical vs friendly)
- Word count

### Rule 4: Complete SEO/AEO Blocks
EVERY article must have:
- Short Answer (40-60 words)
- Key Takeaways (4-5 points)
- FAQ section (8-12 questions)
- Article schema
- FAQ schema
- Canonical URL
- Meta title/description

### Rule 5: Cross-Linking Rules
- Wait until Month 3
- Max 1 link per article
- Natural anchor text only
- One-way flow: posturetips ‚Üí neckhump (never reciprocal)

---

- Answer every "but what about..." question

- Always import Link at top of file
- Escape comparison operators in JSX (`&gt;` and `&lt;`)
- Test mobile-first (most traffic will be mobile)
- Check Lighthouse on every page before deploying

### Avoiding Burnout
- Don't rush - quality beats speed
- Celebrate small wins (10 pages done! ‚úÖ)
- Take breaks between articles
