## üö® What to Do If URLs Don't Index

### After 2 Weeks, If Still Not Indexed:

1. **Check Coverage Issues in GSC**
   - Look for specific error messages
   - "Discovered - currently not indexed" is normal (be patient)
   - "Crawled - currently not indexed" means low quality signal (unlikely with our changes)

2. **Verify Technical Issues**
   - Check robots.txt isn't blocking
   - Verify no noindex tags
   - Confirm canonical URLs are correct
   - Test page loads properly (no 404s)

3. **Boost Internal Links Further**
   - Add more links from homepage
   - Link from footer (site-wide)
   - Add to main navigation

4. **Wait Longer (Patience Required)**
   - Some pages take 4-6 weeks
   - Google prioritizes based on perceived value
   - Our changes will compound over time

## üí° Pro Tips

‚úÖ **Submit in morning (9-11 AM PST)** - Google seems to process faster during US business hours
‚úÖ **Don't resubmit same URL multiple times** - Doesn't help, may look spammy
‚úÖ **Focus on newly updated pages first** - They have better content now
‚úÖ **Be patient** - Indexing is not instant, takes 1-4 weeks typically
‚úÖ **Check mobile usability** - Google mobile-first indexing prioritizes mobile-friendly pages

---

**Remember:** You can only submit ~10 URLs per day in GSC. Spread submissions over 5-7 days for best results.
