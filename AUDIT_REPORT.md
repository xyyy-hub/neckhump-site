## ⚠️ **OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS** (Not Blockers)

### **1. Deploy New Components**
The RelatedArticles and NavigationPathway components are ready but not yet used. Consider adding them to key pages:

**RelatedArticles** - Good candidates:
- /neck-hump-guide
- /neck-hump-exercises
- /posture-correction-guide
- /exercise-library
- /how-to-fix-posture-at-home

**NavigationPathway** - Good candidates:
- /neck-hump-guide (stage: 'beginner')
- /neck-hump-exercises (stage: 'exercises')
- /desk-setup-guide (stage: 'environment')
- /how-to-fix-posture-at-home (stage: 'maintenance')

### **2. Use ComparisonTable Component**
The ComparisonTable component exists but isn't used yet. Good candidates:
- /best-pillow-for-neck-hump (compare pillow types)
- /help/product-questions pages (compare products)
- /neck-hump-exercises (compare exercise difficulty/equipment)

### **3. Add More Citations**
The Citations component is only used on 1 page. Consider adding to:
- /neck-hump-causes
- /tech-neck-prevention-guide  
- /how-to-fix-posture-at-home
- Other medically-focused pages
