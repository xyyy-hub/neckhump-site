# Google Search Console "Page with Redirect" Fix Guide

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Issue:** GSC validation failure due to double redirect chain  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Awaiting verification

---

## üîç **What Was the Problem?**

Google Search Console detected these HTTP URLs:
- ‚ùå `http://neckhump.com/`
- ‚ùå `http://www.neckhump.com/`  
- ‚ùå `https://neckhump.com/` (no www)

These had a **double redirect chain:**
```
http://neckhump.com 
  ‚Üí https://neckhump.com     (Redirect #1)
  ‚Üí https://www.neckhump.com (Redirect #2)
```

**Why it's bad:**
- Google prefers **single redirects**
- Double redirects waste crawl budget
- Causes "Page with redirect" validation failures
- Delays indexing

---

## ‚úÖ **What We Fixed**

### **1. Added `vercel.json` Configuration**

Created `/vercel.json` to force **ONE direct redirect** from any variant:

```json
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/:path*",
      "has": [
        {
          "type": "host",
          "value": "neckhump.com"
        }
      ],
      "destination": "https://www.neckhump.com/:path*",
      "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**New redirect chain (FIXED):**
```
http://neckhump.com ‚Üí https://www.neckhump.com (Single 308 redirect)
https://neckhump.com ‚Üí https://www.neckhump.com (Single 308 redirect)
```

### **2. Committed and Deployed**

```bash
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Fix double redirect: force all variants to https://www.neckhump.com in single redirect"
git push
```

Vercel auto-deployed the fix. ‚úÖ

## üìã **Steps to Complete in Google Search Console**

### **Step 1: Wait for Vercel Deployment (5 minutes)**

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Check that latest deployment is "Ready"
3. Wait 5 minutes for DNS/CDN propagation

### **Step 2: Verify the Fix**

Test that redirects now work in **ONE hop:**

```bash
# Test 1: HTTP non-www should go directly to HTTPS www
curl -I http://neckhump.com

# Expected: ONE 308 redirect to https://www.neckhump.com

# Test 2: HTTPS non-www should go directly to HTTPS www
curl -I https://neckhump.com

# Expected: ONE 308 redirect to https://www.neckhump.com
```

**How to verify:**
- Open Terminal/Command Prompt
- Run the curl commands above
- You should see `Location: https://www.neckhump.com/` in the response
- Should be **ONE redirect** (not two)

### **Step 3: Remove Old HTTP URLs from GSC**

1. Go to https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Select property: `neckhump.com`
3. Navigate to: **Indexing ‚Üí Removals** (left sidebar)
4. Click "**New Request**"
5. Enter: `http://neckhump.com/`
6. Select: "**Temporarily remove URL**"
7. Click "**Submit**"
8. Repeat for:
   - `http://www.neckhump.com/`
   - `https://neckhump.com/` (if needed)

**Note:** Temporary removal lasts 6 months, which is enough time for Google to recrawl and update.

### **Step 4: Request Revalidation**

1. Go to: **Page indexing ‚Üí Page with redirect**
2. Click "**Start New Validation**" button (top right)
3. Google will recrawl all URLs (takes 7-14 days)
4. Monitor progress in GSC

### **Step 5: Force Re-Crawl of Homepage**

1. Go to: **URL Inspection** tool (top search bar)
2. Enter: `https://www.neckhump.com/`
3. Click "**Request Indexing**"
4. Wait for confirmation (takes 1-2 minutes)
5. Repeat for top 5 priority pages:
   - `https://www.neckhump.com/neck-hump-exercises`
   - `https://www.neckhump.com/neck-hump-guide`
   - `https://www.neckhump.com/how-to-get-rid-of-neck-hump-fast`
   - `https://www.neckhump.com/dowagers-hump-exercises`
   - `https://www.neckhump.com/learn`

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Timeline for Resolution**

| Action | Time |
|--------|------|
| Vercel deployment | ‚úÖ Complete (5 min) |
| DNS/CDN propagation | ‚úÖ Complete (5-10 min) |
| GSC URL removals | 24-48 hours |
| Validation complete | 7-14 days |
| All pages re-indexed | 2-4 weeks |

---

## üß™ **Verification Checklist**

After completing GSC steps, verify over next 2 weeks:

- [ ] **Day 1:** Verify single redirects work (curl test)
- [ ] **Day 2:** Check GSC "URL removals" showing pending
- [ ] **Day 7:** Check validation progress in GSC
- [ ] **Day 14:** Verify validation passed
- [ ] **Day 30:** Confirm no more "redirect" errors

---

## üîí **Prevention (Already Implemented)**

These safeguards are now in place:

‚úÖ **vercel.json** enforces single redirect  
‚úÖ **sitemap.xml** uses only `https://www.neckhump.com` URLs  
‚úÖ **robots.txt** points to HTTPS sitemap  
‚úÖ **All canonical tags** use `https://www.neckhump.com`  
‚úÖ **All internal links** use relative paths (auto-resolve to canonical)  
‚úÖ **All structured data** uses `https://www.neckhump.com` format  

---

## üÜò **Troubleshooting**

### **If validation still fails after 14 days:**

1. **Check for external HTTP backlinks:**
   ```
   Google: site:neckhump.com http://neckhump.com
   ```
   If found, update or disavow them.

2. **Check for mixed content:**
   ```bash
   grep -r "http://neckhump.com" /path/to/project
   ```
   Should return no results.

3. **Verify Vercel domain settings:**
   - Go to Vercel ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains
   - Ensure `www.neckhump.com` is marked as **Primary**
   - Ensure `neckhump.com` redirects to `www.neckhump.com`

4. **Check for redirect loops:**
   ```bash
   curl -L http://neckhump.com | head -5
   ```
   Should resolve to `https://www.neckhump.com` without loops.

### **If still having issues:**

Contact Vercel support with this information:
- Project: neckhump-site
- Issue: Need non-www ‚Üí www redirect in ONE hop
- Current behavior: Double redirect detected
- Expected: Direct 308 redirect from all variants to https://www.neckhump.com

## üìä **Expected Results**

After fix is complete:

**Before (with error):**

## üìù **Summary**

**Problem:** Double redirect chain causing GSC validation failure

**Solution:** Added `vercel.json` to force single-hop redirects  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed and live  
**Next Steps:** Complete GSC cleanup (Steps 3-5 above)  
**Timeline:** 7-14 days for full validation

**This is a common issue and the fix is standard. No negative SEO impact expected.** ‚úÖ
