# Help Center Audit - Complete

**Date**: January 11, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ All Issues Resolved

## Summary

Completed comprehensive audit of all help center pages. The issue was NOT empty content, but a **component bug** that prevented pages from rendering properly.

## Bug Found & Fixed

### Issue
The `HelpArticle.js` component had a property mismatch:
- Component expected: `relatedQuestions` with `href` and `title` properties
- Pages were providing: `relatedQuestions` with `link` and `text` properties

This caused a client-side rendering error showing "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred".

### Fix Applied
Updated `/components/HelpArticle.js` (lines 150-154) to accept both property formats:

```javascript
// Before (caused errors):
href={question.href}
{question.title}

// After (works with both formats):
href={question.href || question.link}
{question.title || question.text}
```
